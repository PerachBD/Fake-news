[{"title": "Donald Trump Says John McCain Is No War Hero, Setting Off Another Storm", "text": "After weeks when many of them treaded lightly around Mr. Trump, who once again Saturday refused to rule out a third-party run, Republican leaders seized the opportunity to unambiguously speak out against a candidate they see as effectively hijacking their primaries.\n\nYet for all the outrage among party elites, some attendees at the Christian conservative conference where Mr. Trump made his comments were not nearly as offended, a reminder of the chasm between the Republican power structure and its grass roots.\n\nWith his attack on Mr. McCain, Mr. Trump, whose caustic language about immigration has lifted him in early polls, created a new, revealing litmus test for how the Republican presidential hopefuls are handling the bombastic real estate mogul.\n\nSeveral of Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican opponents immediately denounced his comments, and one said the remarks disqualified him from the presidency.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump owes every American veteran and in particular John McCain an apology,\u201d said Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, upon taking the stage. Mr. Perry argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s comment made him unfit to be commander in chief.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that anybody serious about being president would not be disrespectful of prisoners of war, and predicted that the early nominating states would render an unmistakable verdict on Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think they\u2019re going to say: \u2018Donald Trump, you\u2019re fired,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Graham said to laughs and applause.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Mr. Perry and Mr. Graham, both retired Air Force officers who have struggled to get traction in the race, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments represented an opportunity to highlight their own military service and demonstrate to primary voters that they would not tolerate any impugning of a veteran.\n\nAs telling was the difference between how Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas reacted to Mr. Trump. Both are running aggressively in Iowa and pursuing the sort of conservative voters who are now considering Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Walker, who leads in early Iowa polls, had previously resisted criticizing Mr. Trump. But in a sign of how quickly Mr. Trump\u2019s provocation reshaped the expectations of how candidates should treat him, Mr. Walker immediately changed course after Mr. Trump questioned Mr. McCain\u2019s military record.\n\n\u201cI unequivocally denounce him,\u201d Mr. Walker said at a campaign stop in Sioux City, Iowa.\n\nMr. Cruz, who poses a threat here on Mr. Walker\u2019s right, was more cautious. He told reporters before his remarks here that Mr. McCain is \u201can American hero,\u201d but added that he would not \u201csay something bad about Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s reluctance to confront Mr. Trump was perhaps best explained by the reaction to Mr. Perry\u2019s denunciation: While many in the crowd applauded, the ovation did not last long and nobody in the audience of nearly 3,000 stood to show their approval.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They\u2019re rapists and some, I assume, are good people.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also treated the businessman more delicately in the 2012 campaign, when Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s nominee, sought and publicly accepted Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement even after the businessman had questioned whether President Obama was born in the United States.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after his turn on stage, Mr. Trump tried to soften the remarks, saying that any United States veteran who was a prisoner of war was heroic. He also shifted his comments to assuage veterans, saying that Mr. McCain had failed to address their needs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m with the veterans all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider them heroes.\u201d\n\nAsked about his own military draft status, Mr. Trump, 69, said that he received medical deferments from the Vietnam War because of a bone spur in his foot. Mr. Trump could not recall which foot was afflicted.\n\nYet Mr. Trump\u2019s awkward and ill-suited remarks about religion and marriage here may have done more damage to his candidacy, at least with Christian conservatives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a religious person,\u201d Mr. Trump offered. \u201cI go to church. Do I do things that are wrong? I guess so.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also struggled to answer if he had ever sought forgiveness from God, before reluctantly acknowledging that he had not. \u201cIf I do something wrong, I try to do something right,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t bring God into that picture.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. Trump raised eyebrows with language rarely heard before an evangelical audience \u2014 saying \u201cdamn\u201d and \u201chell\u201d when discussing education and the economy \u2014 while also describing the taking of communion in glib terms. \u201cWhen we go in church and I drink the little wine, which is about the only wine I drink, and I eat the little cracker \u2014 I guess that\u2019s a form of asking forgiveness,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nIf all that was not enough to roil the button-downed crowd, he also described his three marriages in starkly frank terms, conceding that he had difficulty finding a work-life balance.\n\n\u201cIt was a work thing, it wasn\u2019t a bad thing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt was very hard for anybody to compete against the work.\u201d\n\nDespite his marital problems over the years, Mr. Trump said that he was always available to his children and that he did his best to have dinner with them on most nights even when his work was grueling. He worked hard, he said, to instill good values and steer them away from drugs, alcohol and cigarettes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was actually a great father,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI was a better father than I was a husband.\u201d\n\nIt was these comments, not his attack on Mr. McCain, that prompted the most muttering and unease in the audience.\n\n\u201cWell, I was turned off at the very start because I didn\u2019t like his language,\u201d Becky Kruse, of Lovilia, Iowa, said of Mr. Trump, not mentioning his comments about Mr. McCain. Ms. Kruse said she likes Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on immigration and came to the event considering him. \u201cI was not too impressed,\u201d she said, noting Mr. Trump\u2019s comment about not seeking God\u2019s forgiveness. \u201cHe sounds like he isn\u2019t really a born-again Christian.\u201d", "source_url": "https://www.nytimes.com", "date": "2015-07-19", "fake or real": "F", "authors": ["Alan Rappeport", "Jonathan Martin"], "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/18/us/18FIRSTDRAFT-trump/18FIRSTDRAFT-trump-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/19/us/19DEMS/19DEMS-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/18/us/18WATCHING2-trump/18WATCHING2-trump-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/19/us/19DONORS2/19DONORS2-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/18/us/18WATCHING2-trump/18WATCHING2-trump-master1050.jpg"]}, {"title": "Scientists Miscalculate, Solar Eclipse Actually Next Year", "text": "HOUSTON, TX \u2014 After double-checking their math, scientists have announced that the total lunar eclipse predicted for August 21, 2017, will occur August 3, 2018.\n\n\u201cDue to a computational mishap, the eclipse we projected for later this month will actually take place late next year,\u201d stated NASA astrophysicist Dr. Theodore Moneta at a hastily-planned press conference from Johnson Space Center in Houston. \u201cWe were a bit off.\u201d\n\nDr. Moneta explained that in calculating the date of the eclipse, scientists utilized a complex formula involving geocentric ephemeris for the Sun and Moon, various parameters, constants, and the Besselian elements, but along the way an error went unnoticed.\n\n\u201cIn layman\u2019s terms, we forgot to carry the one,\u201d explained Moneta, a mistake that has plagued 12-year-olds in 7th grade math for centuries.\n\n\u201cThis is an embarrassing day for both science and mathematics,\u201d he added.\n\nFor officials in those states situated within the eclipse\u2019s path of totality preparing for an influx of visitors in the next few weeks, the NASA announcement came as a shock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d stated Matt Mead, governor of Wyoming, upon hearing the news. \u201cObviously, the NASA nerds really dropped the ball on this one.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mead felt that Wyoming would be less affected by the altered date than other locales due the Cowboy State\u2019s inherent awesomeness.\n\n\u201cA visit to our state is spectacular with or without a once-in-lifetime astronomical occurrence,\u201d said Mead. \u201cWyoming doesn\u2019t need an eclipse to shine.\u201d\n\nUse ECLIPSE18 for 18% off your order at adventurewyoming.com!\n\nDisclaimer: This article is satirical in nature.

The spokesman confirmed that plans are far advanced for Carey to do a nationwide tour of small club venues with a four piece backing band. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm the line up yet but East Bay Ray has said he\u2019s up for it, and (Ex H\u00fcsker D\u00fc guitarist) Bob Mould is interested,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also declined to confirm rumours that Carey had recorded a version of the Toy Dolls take on the classic childen\u2019s song \u201cNellie the Elephant\u201d, noted for its raucus chorus of \u201cTRUMP ! TRUMP !

Carey also dated Australian multi Billionaire and cricket fan James Packer.\n\nHowever the pair famously broke off their engagement following a bitter argument over a contested LBW decision in the second test of the 2016 West Indies tour of Australia.", "source_url": "http://rochdaleherald.co.uk", "date": "2017-08-20", "fake or real": "F", "authors": [], "images": ["http://rochdaleherald.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MariaH-Carey.jpg"]}, {"title": "Promoter Found Dead After Exposing Mayweather-McGregor 'Fake Fight'", "text": "A boxing promoter who had been working on the upcoming Mayweather-McGregor bout, was found dead within hours of warning the fight is fixed.\n\nBarry Gibson was found dead in his hometown of Washington D.C. in what has the hallmarks of an execution-style killing, hours after blowing the lid on the Mayweather-McGregor fight backstage at a press conference in Toronto, Canada.\n\nEarly reports claim the 45-year-old was found shot dead in his Jeep, along with one other man, believed to be a colleague.\n\nGibson, a PR executive, had been working alongside Mayweather Promotions as well as McGregor Sports & Entertainment on promoting Saturday\u2019s prize fight between the pair. However Gibson went \u201coff-script\u201d in Toronto and was removed from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly criticizing the pair.\n\nAccording to Gibson, Mayweather and McGregor have organized a \u201cfixed fight\u201d that will earn them both record pay packets and hundreds of millions for broadcasters, but will send jaded boxing fans home disappointed.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest scam in boxing history,\u201d Gibson said in Toronto, according to reports. \u201cI\u2019m telling you now there is more than a gentleman\u2019s agreement between these two assholes. The fight is already completely scripted out.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve me when I say I\u2019ve read it.\u201c\n\n\u201cThese two assholes have been traveling around the world on the same private jet to promote the fight\u2026 Laughing all the way to the bank. The acting you see on stage, don\u2019t believe the hype, they are pals. This is a fix.\u201c\n\nTelling reporters that he is a \u201cboxing fan first, promoter second\u201c, Gibson said \u201cBoxing in 2017 needs great fights, not scams. Boxing in America won\u2019t recover from this.\u201c\n\nEarly reports that stated Gibson had been shot dead in an \u201cexecution-style killing\u201d in D.C. have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.\n\nThe Washington Post has not responded to queries regarding why they unpublished the story. Fight fans on Internet forums are speculating that mainstream media operations, owned by the same oligarchs that are set to cash in heavily on the fixed fight, have ordered all reports about Barry Gibson and his warnings to be scrubbed.\n\nMayweather vs. McGregor, billed as \u201cThe Billion Dollar Fight\u201c, takes place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada on Saturday 26 August, and rumors are circulating that Gibson was taken out to ensure the high stakes fight goes ahead, and the fighters and media organizations receive their hundreds of millions of dollar paydays.\n\nThe fight is expected to earn Mayweather upwards of $400 million for his 50th professional fight, if the TV viewership achieves it\u2019s targets. McGregor, who will be making his pro boxing debut, will earn at least $75 million.\n\nThe pairs\u2019 exact earnings will not be known until after the fight as they both signed confidentiality agreements preventing them from talking about the subject.\n\nAccording to Gibson, the numbers are all important, because the fight itself is a scam. The decision has already been decided, and a re-match has already been agreed by both camps.\n\n\u201cMcGregor is going to stalk Mayweather and keep him within punching range while waiting for an opening and punching his face right off. Mayweather is going to let McGregor get some jabs in, he\u2019s going to get knocked down, but as the fight goes on he\u2019s going to dance and keep McGregor at bay. In the eleventh round McGregor is going to throw his shoulder out so they can both go home with egos intact, counting their millions.\n\n\u201cOf course there will be a rematch. That might be more of a genuine fight. But knowing these two, probably not.\u201d\n\nMexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez, a four-weight world champion who fought Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, has also warned the Mayweather vs McGregor fight is a \u201cfake fight, a false fight\u201d in an interview with Fight Hub TV.", "source_url": "https://newspunch.com", "date": "2017-08-21", "fake or real": "F", "authors": ["Paul John Norbury", "Gabriel Anibal Toribio", "Stephen Coyle", "Don Skene", "Jared French", "Ed Wade", "Roderick Henderson", "Calvin Johnson", "Pete Repeat", "Marshal Brutus"], "images": ["https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/roundup-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-Haunted-Doll-of-Hokkaido-Whose-Hair-Wont-Stop-Growing3-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/YouTube-censor-ron-paul-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/boxing-promoter-found-dead.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/911-eyewitness-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/big-pharma-doctors-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/donald-trump-vaccines-autism-326x245.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/podesta-congress-russia-probe-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/earth-magnetic-reversal-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/news-punch-logo-sitewide.png", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dick-gregory-80x60.png", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Flint-empoyees-dead-326x245.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Prophecy_-Grom-Google-Glass-to-Microchip-Implant-in-your-Brain-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Syria2-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chuck-schumer-shut-down-voter-fraud-probe-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/boxing-promoter-found-dead-678x381.jpg", "http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20708397_10208754895623982_6851716433403053946_n.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Seagull2-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mysterious-hallucination-illness-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/boxing-promoter-found-dead-696x526.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Erdogan-Turkey-insults-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/US-Army-Special-Operations-Command-Europe-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Irans-supreme-leader-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/13th-ammendment-constitution-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/illuminati-member-reveals-all-326x245.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/scared-stiff-3-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/HELICOPTER-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mossad-leader-ISIS-libya-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017-08-27_165439-80x60.png", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fake-moon-landings-NASA-80x60.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=/7lYk1a4eFf26C", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CIA-wtc7-confession-326x245.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Trump-last-president-book-80x60.jpg", "https://newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/6cae9ccd8c59189ae87b9eb3c62a3828.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/21-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NWA-RAP-CIA-80x60.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/harvard-vaccines-326x245.jpg", "http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wapo-boxing-execution-headline.jpg", "https://cdns.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/assange-missing-internet-outage-80x60.jpg"]}, {"title": "White Supremacist Who Killed Protester Is A Democrat And Visited Obama In Oval Office \u2013 Land Of The Free \u2013 Home Of The Brave", "text": "Conservative author Dinesh D\u2019Souza uncovered something that blows the Left\u2019s whole narrative to bits.

Their injuries ranged from life-threatening to minor, he said. The driver of the car will be charged with criminal homicide, Thomas said. Albermarle County Regional Jail officials identified the suspect as 20-year-old James Alex Fields of Ohio.\n\nPolice officials said Fields would be charged with one count of second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run. In addition, the FBI announced Saturday night it would open a civil rights investigation into the circumstances of the death.\n\nJames Alex Fields, Jr., charged with second degree murder in Charlottesville, Va. (Photo: Albemarle Charlottesville Regional Jail)\n\n\u201cOur hearts break for the casualties and injuries,\u201d Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer said at a press conference.\n\nAbout three hours after the car crash, a Virginia State Police Bell 407 helicopter crashed about 7 miles from the scene. Police reports said the helicopter crashed in a wooded area and the two pilots died. No one on the ground was injured. The helicopter had been assisting in police supervision of the protests.\n\nVirginia State Police identified the two as Lt. Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Va. and Trooper-Pilot Berke Bates, 40, of Quinton, Va. Cullen was a 23-year veteran of the force and is survived by his wife and two sons. Bates was a three-year veteran of the force and joined the aviation unit last month.\n\nThe driver of a silver Dodge Challenger plowed into one of the groups streaming away from the rally at Emancipation Park through the narrow downtown streets.\n\nMore: Trump on Charlottesville brawls: 'There is no place for this kind of violence'\n\nMore: Shocking video shows car slam into protesters at 'Unite the Right' rally\n\nMore: Why is Charlottesville ground zero for white supremacists?\n\nMore: Confederate monuments, more than 700 across USA, aren't budging\n\nPresident Trump, on vacation at his golf club in New Jersey, condemned \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d what he called an \u201cegregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\u201d in Charlottesville. He called for \u201ca swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.\u201d\n\nTrump said he spoke with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and \u201cwe agreed that the hate and the division must stop and must stop right now.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe delivered a message to the white supremacists at an evening press conference: \"Go home, you are not wanted in this great commonwealth, shame on you.\"\n\nThe governor declared a state of emergency shortly before 11 a.m. as the earlier protests and counter-protests turned unruly. He said he was \u201cdisgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence\u201d and blamed \u201cmostly out-of-state protesters.\u201d\n\nThe violence played out against a backdrop of unofficial, armed militia groups ringing the park, where the rally was called to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nSome 500 protesters among the white nationalist and alt-right groups left the park shortly after state police, using megaphones, declared the gathering an \"unlawful assembly\" at 11:40 a.m., about 20 minutes before the rally was scheduled to begin.\n\nClusters of alt-right activists and counter-protesters remained, however, raising fears of more clashes. Police then put on gas masks as they stepped up efforts to disperse the crowds, which then left the park.\n\nMcAuliffe declared the state of emergency to give local authorities more resources to quell the disturbance. Officials had already deployed police to maintain order and McAuliffe had placed the Virginia National Guard on standby.\n\nThis is the Virginia statute on unlawful assembly #cvilleaug12pic.twitter.com/dyqdEN7k71 \u2014 VA State Police (@VSPPIO) August 12, 2017\n\nGovernor McAuliffe has declared a state of emergency to aid state response to violence at Alt-Right rally in Charlottesville \u2014 Terry McAuliffe (@GovernorVA) August 12, 2017\n\nThe clashes, mainly between white nationalists and anti-fascist groups, broke out as crowds moved toward the park where the Lee statue is located. At one point, dozens of people used wooden poles from their flags and banners as weapons. Others threw trash and bottles into the opposing ranks of protesters as the crowds swelled.\n\nNumerous protesters came prepared, wearing helmets and flak jackets and charging into crowds holding plastic riot shields. Protesters on one side of a square held up anti-fascist signs and Black Lives Matter banners, while groups on the other displayed Confederate flags and iron cross banners.\n\nLaurel Cummings, who works at the Oakhurst Inn in Charlottesville, said people have been canceling their rooms this weekend due to concerns about safety. She has also been warning guests about avoiding the downtown area.\n\n\u201cI came in to work today praying that no one was going to check in with a Swastika on their arm,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew I would refuse to check them in. If that gets me fired, I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d\n\nFrom his vacation home in New Jersey, Trump tweeted: \"We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\"\n\nUnidentified militia has arrived at #EmancipationPark ahead of the #Charlottesville rally with guns in tow. pic.twitter.com/zCLCBU78PF \u2014 Craig Stanley (@_CraigStanley) August 12, 2017\n\nAs dusk fell Saturday, Charlottesville residents described a city buried in chaos.\n\n\"There were fist fights breaking out,\u201d said Brad Slocum, a 2012 University of Virginia graduate who attended Saturday's rally at Emancipation Park. His friends were attacked with flag poles, he said, and he left with some bruises after an attempt to de-escalate a skirmish between a protester and counter protester.\n\nSlocum said the scene was frightening, but showing up was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in taking direct action to stand up for what I believe is right,\u201d Slocum said. \u201cI consider bigotry and racial discrimination to be completely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nSaturday's violence followed a spontaneous march the previous night by torch-wielding protesters on the University of Virginia campus that was broken up by police as an unlawful assembly after scuffles broke out and pepper spray filled the air.\n\nThat came after a federal court injunction rejected the city's earlier attempt to move the \"Unite the Right\" rally to another park.\n\nOn the eve of the rally, McAuliffe, a Democrat, said he would prefer that no one shows up at the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\n\"I want to urge my fellow Virginians who may consider joining either in support or opposition to the planned rally to make alternative plans,\" he said.\n\nPolice chief Thomas said the unfolding events created a \"lot of anxiety\" in the community, but he felt it had sufficient resources to meet the \"significant challenge.\"\n\nCity authorities were particularly alarmed by Friday night's march by hundreds of white nationalists who gathered at the feet of a statue of Thomas Jefferson on the UVa. campus, chanting \"You will not replace us.\"\n\nFights broke out as some marchers bearing tiki torches swung them at others, the Daily Progress reported.\n\nUVa. President Teresa Sullivan said she was \"deeply saddened and disturbed by the hateful behavior\" displayed by the marchers.\n\nIn the past few months, white nationalist groups have paid particular attention to Charlottesville, a progressive college town where over 80% of residents voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Charlottesville City Council voted in May to sell the Lee statue, but a judge issued a temporary injunction that blocked the city from moving the statue for six months, The Daily Progress reported.\n\nAfter the vote to remove the statue, several dozen demonstrators, led by prominent white supremacist Richard Spencer, gathered at night by the Lee statue, wielding torches.\n\nIn July, Ku Klux Klan members held a rally in Charlottesville in Justice Park, where they were met with more than a thousand upset counter-protesters.\n\nWhite nationalist groups continue to return to Charlottesville partly because they saw the May torch light gathering as a great success, noted Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\u201cThey loved the imagery of that. They were over the moon about that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey viewed it as having been a wonderful recruiting tool.\"\n\nGabe Cavallaro reports for The (Staunton) News Leader.

Did you have chicken wings or rat wings? This article caught my attention because I am a big fan of chicken wings.\n\nWell, apparently customs at the Port of San Francisco seized several illegal containers originating from China that contained rat meat being passed off for chicken wings.\n\nThe Super Bowl is a period where chicken wings are in high demand and where restaurants and grocery stores often face a penury\u201d explains FDA inspector, Ronald Jones. \u201cThis is where the illegal market comes in. Although there is nothing dangerous about consuming rat meat if it is properly cooked, United States laws prohibit the import and sales of rat meat as a comestible item,\u201d he adds.\n\nLooks like there is no way of knowing whether you are eating chicken or rat meat. This is confusing to me because I never knew rats had wings.\n\nFDA spokesman Jenny Brookside admits there is no clear way for consumers to see the difference.\u201cUnfortunately, it is too late for the produce that has already been sold on the market. It is up to consumers to try to identify the quality and source of the meat that is packaged, but there is no absolute way of determining for 100% if the meat in your plate is chicken or rat\u201d she admits with honesty. \u201cIf you find that your chicken wings taste slightly different from usual, it is a good bet that they might be counterfeit meat, but this can be easily hidden through the use of different ingredients and spices,\u201d she acknowledges as a warning.\n\nThis was some interesting information I thought we the consumers should know.

Allure of the Seas sank a Carnival Cruise Line ship that crossed into disputed waters off the coast of the Bahamas, sources said Thursday.\n\nThe Allure, an Oasis-class recreational vessel with a standing crew of around 2,300, opened fire on Carnival\u2019s M.S. Magic after it allegedly ignored repeated warnings not to approach Coco Cay, a private island owned by Royal Caribbean. After sustaining several direct hits, the enemy ship\u2019s hull reportedly ruptured, immediately flooding its bingo hall and spa with seawater, collapsing several theme restaurants, and ultimately killing all 3,675 guests on board.\n\n\u201cBy approaching within three nautical miles of Coco Cay, the M.S. Magic was in direct violation of the terms of the 2011 Caribbean Nights cease-fire agreement,\u201d said Captain David Beeman of the Allure, stating that the attack was necessary to safeguard the recreational interests of the customers he is sworn to serve. \u201cPer standard procedure, our limbo emcee first alerted the Magic that it had entered our territorial waters by issuing a verbal warning and blasting conga music over our PA system. When the ship refused to change course, we proceeded to launch a broadside from our starboard cannons, delivering a direct hit to their most crucial facilities, including the engine room, water slide, and Red Frog rum bar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe suffered just one casualty ourselves, losing a tango instructor to friendly fire,\u201d he added.\n\nPulling up alongside the smaller enemy vessel, the 1,187-foot Allure reportedly extended its powerful battery of guns from the portholes of a lower-deck theater currently staging Mamma Mia! Witnesses said Magic patrons standing in line for the 24-hour seafood buffet had little time to take cover before the Allure opened fire, scattering body parts and shrimp scampi all over the ship\u2019s pool deck and mini-golf course.\n\n\u201cWhen the first shells hit, you could see blasted sections of the hull, bloody scraps of cargo shorts, and flaming flip-flops raining down into the ocean all around,\u201d said Allure passenger Nicole Rice, adding that a few Magic guests tried to run for safety behind overturned massage tables, but were set upon by a Royal Caribbean boarding party that had crossed over with the assistance of their ship\u2019s zip-line and ropes-course operators. \u201cOnce the second round of fire took out the piano bar and Guy Fieri\u2019s Burger Joint, it was pretty much all over. The Magic had just dropped anchor for the Dune Buggy Heritage Adventure Tour, so it really had no chance of escape.\u201d\n\nMaritime historians are calling the attack upon the Magic the deadliest encounter between rival ocean liners since the so-called Cruise Wars of the 1990s, when the wrecks of sunken pleasure vessels littered the waters from Fort Lauderdale to St. Kitts. During that era, the upstart Disney Cruise Line came to rule the waves, and marauders dressed as Pinocchio, Goofy, Tinker Bell, and other company-owned mascots were known to slit the throats of their competitors\u2019 guests and plunder everything from bar supplies to blackjack tables to karaoke equipment.\n\nDespite official explanations, Thursday\u2019s attack is actually believed to be in retaliation for a 2013 incident in which a Royal Caribbean vessel on a nine-day Best of the Bahamas cruise was captured off the coast of Paradise Island. According to deck logs, its entire passenger list was impressed into service as caterers aboard Carnival\u2019s Breeze flagship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the sight of the Magic\u2019s crew and guests desperately trying to bail out the Club O2 teen zone as the ship started to tilt, causing all the deck furniture, the ice cream sundae station, and those seniors on their church group trip to go sliding off into the sea,\u201d Allure passenger Jason Heidt said. \u201cThen I guess they lost power, because suddenly all the party lights shut off and everyone in the Punchliner comedy club went silent as the ship capsized.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone except Joe Rogan,\u201d Heidt continued. \u201cHe kept on telling jokes until he was completely underwater.\u201d", "source_url": "http://www.theonion.com", "date": "2017-07-20", "fake or real": "F", "authors": [], "images": ["http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5690/5/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5803/4/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5815/3/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5664/0/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5808/7/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5676/6/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5664/5/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5774/7/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/2652/6/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5805/5/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5762/0/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5707/0/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5686/7/16x9/600.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?c1=2&c2=6036328&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=1.3&cj=1", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5774/0/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5682/9/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5828/1/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5819/0/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5707/8/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5780/4/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5675/4/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5815/6/16x9/600.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d4P3FpSypJrlA.gif?labels=_fp.event.Default", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5668/9/16x9/600.jpg", "http://assets2.onionstatic.com/onion/static/images/onion_logo.png", "https://assets2.onionstatic.com/onion/static/images/onion_logo.png", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5703/4/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5672/9/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5695/4/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5780/4/16x9/1200.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5797/7/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/2600/8/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5676/4/16x9/600.jpg", "http://assets2.onionstatic.com/onion/static/images/onion-dingbat_60x60.png", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5828/0/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5708/8/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5768/4/16x9/600.jpg", "https://assets2.onionstatic.com/onion/static/images/ad-block-check.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5683/7/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5819/5/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5812/4/16x9/600.jpg", "http://images2.onionstatic.com/onion/5703/5/16x9/600.jpg"]}, {"title": "\u2018Taco Trucks on Every Corner\u2019: Trump Supporter\u2019s Anti-Immigration Warning", "text": "\u201cMy culture is a very dominant culture, and it\u2019s imposing and it\u2019s causing problems.

Some anti-fascist protesters, wearing black and with their faces covered, chased or beat Trump supporters and organizers who had scheduled and then canceled the \u201canti-Marxist\u201d rally, citing concerns over safety.\n\nPolice, and in some cases other counter-protesters, stepped in to halt the violence or escort the victims away from the area. Officers reported 14 arrests, many of them for violations of the city\u2019s emergency rules banning masks, sticks and potential weapons inside the demonstration area.\n\nThe clashes came despite widespread calls from activists and elected officials across the Bay Area for peaceful civil disobedience and underscores Berkeley\u2019s growing reputation for violent reaction by the far left. Other protests earlier this year in the city turned ugly, with far-left and far-right forces fighting in the streets.\n\nSome in Berkeley worried that Sunday\u2019s chaos, captured on video and quickly disseminated through social media, would provide unwanted ammunition to Trump and his supporters.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep producing this audio-visual propaganda,\u201d said Andrew Noruk, a counter-protester who denounced the fights. \u201cIt is recruiting for the right.\u201d\n\nThe incidents came a day after a series of mostly peaceful activities in San Francisco, where demonstrators also marched in response to a planned far-right rally near the Golden Gate Bridge. Counter-protesters there boasted that they had shown that far-right groups, including neo-Nazis and white supremacists, were not welcome. Police reported one arrest, for public intoxication.\n\nIn Berkeley, the demonstration of more than 4,000 people pulled heavily from area labor unions, church groups and liberal activists \u2014 but also scores of young people clad in all black, some carrying shields and others with bandanas pulled over their faces.\n\nThose activists are sometimes referred to as \u201cantifa,\u201d a name taken by anti-fascist organizations formed to oppose white nationalists. They are known for their \u201cpunch a Nazi\u201d bent.\n\nThe counter-demonstrators were in the city to protest the \u201cSay No to Marxism in America\u201d rally, police said. Several who were expected to speak at the event have been linked to white nationalist sentiments or violence in the past.\n\nKyle Chapman, the far-right activist known as \u201cBased Stickman\u201d who gained fame for his role in previous Berkeley brawls, had been listed among speakers for the canceled event, but was not seen. On Friday, during a hearing on a pending felony weapons charge related to a prior rally, a judge ordered Chapman to stay away from Sunday\u2019s demonstration.\n\nOther planned attendees included Augustus Invictus, a Florida-based white supremacist who attended a torch-lit rally in Charlottesville, Va., according to the Anti-Defamation League. Invictus was not seen Sunday either.\n\nOne far-right figure who did show up was Johnny Benitez, the alias of an Orange County resident who organized an \u201cAmerica First\u201d rally in Laguna Beach. Protesters got into shoving matches after he appeared, with some screaming \u201cGo home, Nazi.\u201d\n\nPolice tried to escort him and Irma Hinojosa, a member of the Southern California group Latinos for Trump, through the crowd and out of the park.\n\nBefore the day had ended, Benitez wrote on Twitter that anti-fascists should be designated as \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the federal government doesn\u2019t move to expose these terrorists the patriots of this country need to prepare for war,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nBenitez was not the only right-wing activist hurried away from scene. Counter-protesters clad in black pounced when Joey Gibson, founder of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer, showed up in the park. Masked protesters began pepper spraying people and used their shields to hit people who appeared to be with Gibson.\n\nGibson, who was behind Saturday\u2019s aborted rally in San Francisco, was handcuffed and escorted away by police. Assistant Chief Jim Libby of the California Highway Patrol\u2019s Golden Gate Division later described the officers\u2019 action as a \u201crescue.\u201d\n\nAnti-fascist protesters also beat one person wearing an American flag. Some threatened to break the cameras of anyone who filmed them, including journalists. Others set off purple smoke bombs.\n\nOne counter-protester, in tears, said she worried that Sunday\u2019s event would be tied to violence. Another, who helped break up a fight, was upset over the altercations.\n\n\u201cWe need to get antifa out of here,\u201d said Jack Harris, 20, of San Francisco.\n\nJoanna Mendelson, senior investigative researcher with the Anti-Defamation League, watched footage of Sunday\u2019s confrontations and said she drew a \u201csharp comparison\u201d between the two weekend events. San Francisco provided a proud example of \u201ca community response to objectionable speech,\u201d she said in an email to The Times.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s story should have only been about the voices of tolerance overpowering those marred by bigotry,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, any violent response, even if perpetrated by a small number, undermines their entire effort to counter the narrative.\u201d\n\nOthers strongly disputed the idea that anti-fascist marchers were initiating violence. Kitty Stryker, a member of counter-protesters known as Struggalo Circus, said she provided medical aid to someone who had been pepper sprayed by a far-right activist.\n\nStryker said she broke up a fight between a Trump supporter and another demonstrator \u2014 and was almost punched in the face. And she argued that counter-protesters shut down the far-right demonstrations with overwhelming numbers, not violence.\n\n\u201cI think that has to do with having strong numbers and solidarity,\u201d she added.\n\nBerkeley has been home to a number of clashes between political opponents this year. Violent protests on the UC Berkeley campus shut down an appearance by Milo Yiannopoulos in February, and subsequent demonstrations in support of Trump collapsed into roving street fights.\n\nIn the days leading up to Sunday\u2019s event, Berkeley officials had laid plans for stronger crowd control in the wake of a violent clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, where demonstrators on each side complained of lax law enforcement.\n\nHeather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal, was killed while protesting against the white supremacist rally.\n\nBerkeley officials prohibited the carrying of weapons, sticks, projectiles and even soda cans in the demonstration area. Officer Jennifer Coats, spokeswoman for the Berkeley Police Department, said 500 officers were on the scene for Sunday\u2019s demonstrations.", "source_url": "http://www.latimes.com", "date": "2017-08-27", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["John Benjamin Oreskes David Zahniser", "Benjamin Oreskes", "Paige St", "James Queally", "David Zahniser"], "images": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-59a391dc/turbine/la-et-hc-game-of-thrones-finale-fan-theories-20170826/70/70x70", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59a31d35/turbine/la-pol-sac-cell-phone-surveillance-transparency-law-20170827/70/70x70", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59a3976f/turbine/la-me-ln-berkeley-protests-20170827", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59a0ad2c/turbine/la-oe-mcmanus-trump-polls-20170827/70/70x70"]}, {"title": "Floyd Mayweather is 50-0, but even he can't defeat Father Time", "text": "LAS VEGAS -- Father Time will always be undefeated, but Floyd Mayweather, who closed out his legendary career on his own terms Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena, came about as close as any fighter can come to beating him.\n\nMayweather came out of a two-year retirement at age 40 to take on UFC 155-pound champion Conor McGregor, because who wouldn't return from a two-year layoff at age 40 to earn, when the cash register stops ringing from the fight, perhaps $300 million for one night's work in another record-breaking event?\n\nMayweather put in real work, too, on his way to a 10th-round technical knockout of McGregor, a novice boxer making his pro debut in a fight that was wholly illogical -- which was probably one of the reasons millions of people were so intrigued.\n\nBut even though Mayweather won -- and easily after McGregor captured maybe three early rounds -- the fact that he had any problems with McGregor whatsoever was a sign he is no longer the fighter who once dominated one star fighter after another, such as Manny Pacquiao, Canelo Alvarez, Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley and Miguel Cotto.\n\nEditor's Picks Mayweather: Was denied $400K wager on self Floyd Mayweather was upset that he couldn't place a $400,000 bet on himself hours before his TKO victory over Conor McGregor, according to multiple sources.\n\nMayweather stops fading McGregor in Round 10 Floyd Mayweather defeated a game but tiring Conor McGregor by TKO in the 10th round Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nHow boxer Conor McGregor became the main attraction When the fight between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather was initially announced, many scoffed at the idea that it would be competitive. McGregor proved his doubters wrong. 2 Related\n\nAs outstanding as McGregor is in the UFC Octagon, he is not a boxer. The fact that he even had remote success, however fleeting, against Mayweather demonstrated that Mayweather is no longer untouchable.\n\nFather Time was knocking on his door, like he does to everyone. Mayweather is no exception, and he knew it even before the fight.\n\n\"I'm not the same fighter I was 21 years ago. I'm not the same fighter I was 10 years ago. I'm not even the same fighter I was two years ago,\" Mayweather said leading up to the fight. It was a refrain he repeated often during the prefight hype.\n\nMayweather is still a fantastic athlete and was in great condition, but he is no exception to the rule. Everybody gets old. He was, however, smart enough to realize it, electing to retire from the sport rather than the sport retiring him, which is what happens to most great fighters.\n\n\"This is my last fight, ladies and gentleman. For sure, this is my last fight,\" he said after the victory that gave him a beautiful 50-0 record to walk away with.\n\nHe disclosed after that fight that he cut sparring short a week earlier than usual because of his aching hands. He has had hand problems throughout his career, and he said he wanted them to be strong for the fight and to make sure he didn't push them too hard in training. It was just another tip of the hat to age.\n\nIn the fight, for the first time in his great 21-year career, it was obvious there was some slippage in Mayweather's game. His legs aren't as good as they were two years ago when he waltzed into retirement after a whitewash of Andre Berto in a welterweight world title defense. He was lured out of retirement by the massive money McGregor could help him generate, but Mayweather was also smart enough to face an opponent with almost no chance to win.\n\nImagine if the Mayweather in the ring on Saturday night was facing a young lion like welterweight world titlist Errol Spence Jr. Imagine if he somehow had agreed to fight middleweight monster Gennady Golovkin. Those fights would not go well for Mayweather.\n\nBut whatever elements of age have caught up to Mayweather, McGregor's inexperience in boxing made it difficult to exploit them for very long.\n\nMayweather claimed his game plan was to go straight at McGregor, which he did a lot of as the fight progressed. But that is not Mayweather's usual style. Usually, he boxes, counter punches and befuddles opponents with speed and reflexes. He said he did it because he felt like he owed boxing fans a more exciting fight after the all-time stinker that he and Pacquiao produced in their monster showdown in 2015. But that is hard to believe, given that Mayweather has fought the same way his whole career, and old dogs don't change their spots. More likely, Mayweather was forced to stand and fight more than usual because McGregor -- and age -- forced him to do that on his aging legs, and there is no shame in that.\n\nConor McGregor had some success against Floyd Mayweather on Saturday night. Mark J. Rebilas/USA TODAY Sports\n\nMayweather got hit with 111 of McGregor's 430 punches. McGregor hit him more than Pacquiao did.\n\nIn fact, according to CompuBox, nine of Mayweather's opponents landed fewer than 100 punches in a 12-round fight -- including Pacquiao, who landed 81. Think about that for a moment: McGregor, who never boxed before, landed more punches against Mayweather -- perhaps the greatest defensive fighter ever -- than Pacquiao.\n\nSo we got a more exciting fight than expected. That's what often happens in boxing when fighters can't move as well as they once did. It forces them to stand in more, and that results in more action.\n\nMayweather was able to get by because he had the perfect opponent in front of him and there's nothing wrong with that. He should be saluted for being able to make vast amounts of money in a fight he had almost no chance to lose. The fight likely will put Mayweather over $1 billion in gross career earnings, so when he said he would happily return to retirement, having set up his children, grandchildren, great-great grandchildren and beyond, it's hard to envision him returning, especially after what his body and Father Time told him Saturday night.\n\nAfter the fight Mayweather talked about his smart investments and business ventures that will keep him busy and earning money. He talked about Mayweather Promotions and efforts to find the next boxing superstar. He talked about maybe even becoming a boxing trainer. Whatever he does, he said he is all done in the ring, and there is little reason to doubt him. There is nothing else he can possibly do except diminish his exceptional legacy.\n\nIt has been a busy time for boxing retirements in the past year. Bernard Hopkins finally walked away at age 51 after getting punched out of the ring by Joe Smith Jr. in his last fight. Wladimir Klitschko called it a day after being stopped by Anthony Joshua in an all-time classic heavyweight title fight. Timothy Bradley lost his last fight to Pacquiao last year and announced his retirement earlier this month, as did Juan Manuel Marquez, who won his last fight against Mike Alvarado but could not, at age 43, shake off a knee injury.\n\nNow it is Mayweather who has joined them in retirement, healthy, wealthy and wise enough to know when enough is enough.", "source_url": "http://www.espn.com", "date": "None", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Espn Com", "Dan Rafael", "Nigel Collins"], "images": ["http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fredesign%2Fassets%2Fimg%2Ficons%2FESPN%2Dicon%2Dboxing.png&w=80&h=80&scale=crop&cquality=40&location=origin", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/columnists/full/rafael_dan.png&w=160&h=160&scale=crop", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2017/0826/r249560_600x400_3-2.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0826%2Fr249561_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2017/0826/r249562_600x400_3-2.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2017/0826/r249558_608x342_16-9.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center"]}, {"title": "VMAs 2017\u2019s Best & Worst Moments", "text": "Here Are the Best & Worst Moments of the 2017 MTV VMAs\n\nThe 2017 MTV Video Music Awards are officially wrapped.

She explained that her daughter worried she was ugly, to which P!nk responded by making a PowerPoint presentation of androgynous rock stars like Prince and David Bowie. The story was cute enough in itself, but then P!nk closed out her speech with an empowering message of her own. \"We don\u2019t change, we take the gravel in the shell and make a pearl, and we help other people change so they can see more kinds of beauty.\"\n\nLogic including suicide attempt survivors in his performance\n\nLogic\u2019s suicide hotline song \"1-800-273-8255\u201d sends a touching message to those struggling with mental health issues, but the reality of the heartbreakingly meaningful track came to fruition when he took the VMAs stage to perform it alongside Alessia Cara and Khalid.

(Desha-Kalyan Chowdhury/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIndia has begun withdrawing troops from a disputed Himalayan region on the border with China, foreign ministries from the two countries announced Monday, defusing a tense stand-off that had threatened to provoke armed conflict between the Asian rivals.\n\nFor the past two months, Indian and Chinese troops had faced off on a plateau in the Doklam area in Himalayas, after Indian troops moved in to prevent the Chinese military building a road into territory claimed by India\u2019s close ally, Bhutan.\n\nChina had repeatedly and furiously denounced the Indian move as a direct infringement of its sovereignty, demanded an immediate and unconditional withdrawal, and warned that conflict was a real possibility if that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nOn Monday, the two sides announced they had reached an agreement.

In a further move that will delight many pro-EU Labour backers, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party will also leave open the option of the UK remaining a member of the customs union and single market for good, beyond the end of the transitional period.\n\nAs Labour becomes party of soft Brexit, hard battles lie ahead Read more\n\nPermanent long-term membership would only be considered if a Labour government could by then have persuaded the rest of the EU to agree to a special deal on immigration and changes to freedom of movement rules.\n\nThe announcement, revealed in the Observer by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, means voters will have a clear choice between the two main parties on the UK\u2019s future relations with the EU after a year in which Labour\u2019s approach has been criticised for lacking definition and appeared at times hard to distinguish from that of the Tories.\n\nThe decision to stay inside the single market and abide by all EU rules during the transitional period, and possibly beyond, was agreed after a week of intense discussion at the top of the party. It was signed off by the leadership and key members of the shadow cabinet on Thursday, according to Starmer\u2019s office.\n\nThe new policy will inevitably be presented by Brexit supporters as evidence Labour is ready to betray the will of the people as expressed in last year\u2019s referendum, which delivered a narrow victory for Leave. And it sets the stage for incendiary arguments with the government on 7 September, when the European Union (withdrawal) bill returns to the Commons for its second reading.\n\nPro-EU Tory MPs, who also support remaining in the single market, will be put under intense pressure by Labour to fall in behind its position and rebel against their own party. If significant numbers were to do so, Theresa May\u2019s already shaky grip on power would be seriously threatened.\n\nNo \u2018constructive ambiguity\u2019. Labour will avoid Brexit cliff edge for UK economy Read more\n\nLiam Fox, the international trade secretary, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, recently made clear that the UK would leave the customs union, as well as the single market, during a transitional period immediately after Brexit.\n\nStarmer says the time for \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d is over. \u201cLabour would seek a transitional deal that maintains the same basic terms that we currently enjoy with the EU. That means we would seek to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during this period. It means we would abide by the common rules of both.\u201d\n\nHe says the Tory position of leaving the single market and customs union would be \u201cunnecessary and a highly risky path to take\u201d. Starmer adds: \u201cWe will always put jobs and the economy first. That means remaining in a form of customs union with the EU is a possible end destination for Labour, but that must be subject to negotiations. It also means that Labour is flexible as to whether the benefits of the single market are best retained by negotiating a new single market relationship or by working up from a bespoke trade deal.\u201d\n\nStarmer has been coming under ever increasing pressure from a group of pro-EU MPs and activists within his party. MPs Heidi Alexander and Alison McGovern have launched an online campaign demanding unequivocal support, launched a website and published a motion for members to submit for debate at next month\u2019s party conference in Brighton, via their constituency Labour parties. \u201cThe Labour party is serious about protecting jobs, tackling austerity and defending the rights of workers and consumers, so staying part of the customs union and in the European Economic Area is a no-brainer,\u201d said the two MPs. \u201cLabour must be able to deliver the ambitious programme of investment in public services which we put to the electorate in 2017.\u201d\n\nLabour\u2019s new approach was announced as Brexit secretary David Davis prepared for the latest round of talks on the UK\u2019s departure with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier, which will take place in Brussels.", "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com", "date": "2017-08-26", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Zoe Williams", "Martin Kettle"], "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0c16865da6d1c010c8f55a8f6b662f66ab036ad/282_17_2718_1631/master/2718.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=dfec067b8b686bd9a7563f23536e231d", "https://beacon.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Brexit%2CEuropean+Union%2CUK+news%2CArticle+50%2CForeign+policy%2CKeir+Starmer%2CPolitics%2CLabour%2CEurope", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=279880532344561&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://beacon.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/971225648/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0c16865da6d1c010c8f55a8f6b662f66ab036ad/282_17_2718_1631/master/2718.jpg?w=300&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=f06686df0c52f4c266ad12690290cd8b"]}, {"title": "Trump business planned Moscow Tower he ran for president", "text": "Trump business planned Moscow Tower he ran for president\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s company pursued plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow as he was running for president. Picture: AP.\n\nIn the run-up to the US presidential primaries last year, Donald Trump\u2019s company was pursuing a plan to build a huge Trump Tower in Moscow, the Washington Post reports.\n\nAmid discussions over the project, a Russian born property developer urged Mr Trump to go to Moscow to push the proposal, and suggested he could get Russian president Vladimir Putin to say \u201cgreat things\u201d about the US presidential hopeful.\n\nThe developer, Felix Sater, predicted in an email that he and the Trump organisation would soon be celebrating one of the biggest residential projects in real estate history and Donald Trump\u2019s election as president, the Post reports.\n\nHowever although the Trump Organisation and investors signed a letter of intent, the project was abandoned at the end of January 16 after they failed to purchase the land or gain permits to proceed.\n\nHowever the newly disclosed deal is yet more proof that Mr Trump\u2019s business was actively pursuing commercial interests in Russia at the same time that he was running for president. The new details are to be turned over to congressional investigators.\n\nIt is the latest evidence of contact between Trump aides and the Russians, most notably a meeting that Donald Trump Jr organised with his brother-in-law Jared Kushner, then campaign manager Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer in June 2016 after Mr Trump Jr was promised the lawyer could provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Moscow Trump Tower project fell through before Mr Trump\u2019s business links with Russia had become a campaign issue. In July 2016, shortly after he won the Republican nomination, Mr Trump denied having any business connections with Moscow, tweeting: \u201cFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia\u201d.\n\nDiscussions about the Moscow Trump Tower started in September 2015, according to the Washington Post. It is unclear how involved Mr Trump was with the project but he had long shown an interest in investing in Moscow. As far back as 1987 he had attempted to partner with the then Soviet government on a hotel project.\n\nAnd in 2005 the Trump Organisation gave Mr Sater a one year deal to attempt to build a Moscow Trump Tower.

It was originally intended to assist local law enforcement in drug investigations.\n\nThe program was expanded in 1997 to include all local law enforcement operations, including counter-terrorism. Since then, according to the government, more than $5 billion in gear has been transferred to state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies.\n\n\"Much of the equipment provided through the 1033 program is entirely defensive in nature ... that protect officers in active shooter scenarios and other dangerous situations,\" the Trump administration proposal says.\n\nBackground:\n\nObama panel cites Camden as model of police reform\n\nObama bans some military sales to local police\n\nMany local forces already have 'banned' military gear\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2xEwNzI", "source_url": "https://www.usatoday.com", "date": "2017-08-27", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Published P M Et Aug", "Kevin Johnson"], "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a0e713a1493b6617d0fb74c424e7ed710590f60/c=0-531-5177-3456&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/08/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/636077537823026962-AP-Police-Military-Equipment.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2009d24507d9265464371233d43b42bf4c3e2885/c=294-0-4890-3456&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2016/08/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/636077537823026962-AP-Police-Military-Equipment.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-nav-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bf340e6c38035b439d10a3b014d69cad64e61e28/c=217-0-3257-2286&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2017/08/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636394412294249363-POLICE-MILITARIZATION.JPG", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-masthead-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-3304.0/images/indicators/facebook-loading.gif"]}, {"title": "18 people rescued from flooded assisted living facility", "text": "Galveston, TX (77553)\n\nToday\n\nWindy early...thunderstorms likely.

We will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market\u2019s long-held commitment to the highest standards.\n\n\u201cTo get started, we\u2019re going to lower prices beginning Monday on a selection of best-selling grocery staples, including Whole Trade organic bananas, responsibly farmed salmon, organic large brown eggs, animal welfare-rated 85 percent lean ground beef and more. And this is just the beginning \u2014 we will make Amazon Prime the customer rewards program at Whole Foods Market and continuously lower prices as we invent together. There is significant work and opportunity ahead, and we\u2019re thrilled to get started.\u201d\n\nAmazon is thrilled, but investors in almost every other grocery operation in the United States? Not so much. The moment all of that news hit the wires, the grocery industry collective saw $12 billion shaved off its books as investors roundly let out a collective \u201cEek!\u201d at the scope of Amazon\u2019s ambitions for Whole Foods.\n\nAmbitions that are only the tip of the iceberg, Skava VP and Head of Innovation Dave Barrowman told Karen Webster in this week\u2019s Topic TBD podcast.\n\n\u201cThese are not fundamental technical integrations. They are making an immediate and big statement with the prices and opening themselves up to a broader customer and creating a loyalty program with Prime at checkout. I think we are going to see much greater integration with online shopping, subscriptions and things like voice going forward.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a big opportunity for Amazon \u2014 if they can carry it off properly and leverage the Whole Foods brand into their collective assault on commerce \u2014 and a massive challenge for everyone else swimming in the retail pool. But, Dave Barrowman said, it\u2019s not an insuperable challenge, only one that will require the legacy players to rethink what they\u2019ve been offering and to whom they\u2019re offering it.\n\nThe Amazon/Whole Foods Opportunity\n\nAmazon\u2019s path through Whole Foods is laden with promise, the Skava executive told Webster, but that potential carries a price. The are many ways to go wrong in grocery retail.\n\n\u201cThe Whole Foods brand has a specific meaning, and so any perceived reduction in quality could bite them with existing loyal customers. They also run the risk of reducing price at the expense of staff compensation, which could lead to real public relations damage.\u201d\n\nThose outcomes, Barrowman noted, are unlikely, since Amazon has an almost equally fanatical reputation for quality control and \u201ca very profitable cloud computing business that lets them have a less profitable or even loss-leading business segment as they are building market share.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s massive reserve of customer goodwill \u2014 with an estimated half of U.S. households signed into the program \u2014 is a massive advantage, particularly given how extremely popular the Amazon Prime menu of services is with the company\u2019s customer base.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t meet a lot of Prime members who are thinking about cancelling. And they now have this new channel to deliver value. Moreover, Prime has historically skewed toward more affluent customers; there is a line of thought that by expanding into Whole Foods and making it more accessible, they are also making Prime more appealing to customers further down the earnings spectrum.\u201d\n\nAnd, Barrowman pointed out, Whole Foods has an affluent customer base that does put value on exclusivity. Amazon is lowering grocery prices on some goods like eggs, kale and bananas, but is keeping much of the Whole Foods pricing scale intact for a variety of other goods.\n\n\u201cAmazon is going to find that balance \u2026 as you can see with the inclusion of the pick-up lockers really working to leverage that physical space to enhance their online eCommerce presence.\u201d\n\nHow Does Old School Grocery Compete?\n\nThat, Karen Webster noted, is the multibillion dollar question, particularly since Amazon and its seductive pull of Prime have been incredibly disruptive in many other retail verticals. There is a reason $12 billion beat it for the ether as the Amazon deal closed.\n\n\u201cThe most important step,\u201d Barrowman told Webster, \u201cis being clear on what their value proposition is and what distinguishes them for their customers.\u201d\n\nThat could be a lot of things, and it could be a combination of things. Assortment, pricing, loyalty, location, staff \u2014 all things that affect what stores customers want to visit; and what is on the \u201cskip\u201d list.\n\n\u201cWhole Foods is great at the products a customer wants to go in to feel, touch and smell. They are less great in terms of things like cereal, where they may not have all the versions of the matching brand.\u201d\n\nA tempting strategy, Barrowman said, is to double down on selection and try to hit where the Whole Foods/Amazon brand is a bit short.\n\nThe problem, he noted, is that a lot of those recurring goods \u2014 cereal, toilet paper and the like \u2014 are the sorts of things that slot nicely into delivery services, an area where Amazon has already invested a lot of energy.\n\nBut even something as simple as improving self-checkout in brick-and-mortar stores can make a massive difference to the consumer experience.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge opportunity with the technology. A lot of groceries have done it, and the experience is OK at best.\u201d\n\nOther low-hanging fruit, he said, is in-store size, since smaller-style markets may be better tailored to consumer need.\n\nBut, Barrowman noted, the best way to get a feel for consumer need is to find a way to know the customer, which is preferable as they are entering the store, not merely as they are being scanned through checkout.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about online commerce, they have a pretty good idea of who you are when you enter the site, and that informs what they can show you. I think you are going to see a lot more investment in this because the goal is really personalization and giving the customer a better experience.\u201d\n\nThat better experience might be around price or it might be around convenience. Webster said that parents of small children tend to sing praises for Walmart grocery pick-up because it turns Saturday shopping into a 20-minute experience of loading provisions into the car instead of a two-hour experience that involves a toddler meltdown.\n\n\u201c[They] \u2026 want three hours of their lives back, and the challenge for retailers in grocery will be to offer as many modalities as possible. Some people want subscriptions, some people want curbside \u2014 and this is what it means to really find a value proposition you can deliver on.\u201d\n\nExtended Commerce\n\nCommerce, Barrowman told Webster, means something very different now \u2014 and likely in the future \u2014 than it ever has in the past. What was once entirely about people interacting with stores as consumers will increasingly shift to include devices acting on behalf of consumers to interact with merchants.\n\n\u201cWe see voice products, responsive AI, devices that know to replenish themselves or at least alert the consumer that the option is available \u2014 this is a very quickly evolving area.\u201d\n\nAnd an area, Webster noted, that is evolving at the consumer\u2019s behest, as the data from PYMNTS\u2019 recent study with Visa demonstrated: Customers want the friction out of commerce and are looking to the IoT to deliver it to them.\n\nAnd that, Barrowman said, is where merchants need to be ready to jump into the next phase and partner with the coffee machine and washing machines that order for themselves, to put those options in front of consumers when the moment is right for the offer.\n\n\u201cGrocers know their business even if they don\u2019t know tech. They need to think carefully about what it is that makes them unique and valuable to their customer. We bring a very flexible technology platform for them to do commerce on so they can see for themselves how to built into being a bigger part of their customer\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nThe goal, he said, is to find ways to make those interactions and touchpoints part of a consumer journey that makes more sense and speaks to need. Instead of just offering a shopping list online, for example, Barrowman expects to see a world with smarter lists that not only let customers log what they need, but that can also make suggestions or at least remember what consumers have already ordered.\n\nThe world has gotten tougher as of this week, Barrowman said. Amazon is very good at bringing customers what they want, and Whole Foods is an excellent perch from which to leverage all of those Prime customers into being Amazon grocery buyers as well.\n\nBut the race is long, and today\u2019s news is part of the journey toward reinvention that is sweeping grocery retail and is bigger than Amazon alone. Barrowman noted the next 18 months will be particularly worth watching.\n\nAnd we can\u2019t help but agree with him.", "source_url": "http://www.pymnts.com", "date": "2017-08-28", "fake or real": "R", "authors": [], "images": ["http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/prepaidcard-80x80.jpeg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Snapchat-Instagram-Digital-Peace-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/themes/flex-mag-sixspoke/images/pymnts-iphone-email.png", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/amazonwholegoods-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/218x150.jpeg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bitcoinrebound-1-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Amazon-Whole-Foods-Skava-Grocery-1000x600.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1743187372604758&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wellsfargo-4-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/prepaidcard-300x180.jpeg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bitcoinrebound-1-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/themes/flex-mag-sixspoke/images/menu-icon.png", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CFPB_studentloan-debt-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_253586485-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wellsfargo-4-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/apple-watch-1-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_658440316-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_253586485-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PYMNTS-Daily-Data-Dive-Starbucks-Global-Expansion-Plans-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CFPB_studentloan-debt-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/startup-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Data-Dive-Daily-Deliveroo-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PYMNTS-Daily-Data-Dive-Starbucks-Global-Expansion-Plans-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_658440316-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/startup-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Snapchat-Instagram-Digital-Peace-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/uber-1-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/amazonwholegoods-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cubanblockchain-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SEC-Court-Rehear-CFPB-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/squareretail-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fbi-bountry-russian-hacker-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/federal-reserve-payment-strategy-dirctor-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/PYMNTSlogo-leadercopy5.png", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/uber-1-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PYMNTSlogo-leadercopy5.png", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/squareretail-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fbi-bountry-russian-hacker-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/apple-watch-1-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Amazon-Whole-Foods-Skava-Grocery.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SEC-Court-Rehear-CFPB-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/federal-reserve-payment-strategy-dirctor-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cubanblockchain-300x180.jpg", "http://cdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Data-Dive-Daily-Deliveroo-80x80.jpg"]}, {"title": "Nintendo Switch Production To \"Ramp Up\" For The Holidays", "text": "The Nintendo Switch has been a difficult console to find for some, with many retailers sold out of their stock and selling through new allocation almost right away.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nApple is preparing to release its iPhone 8 next month, in what is expected to be the company's biggest smartphone launch in years.\n\n2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone , which was first announced by Steve Jobs on 9 January 2007, and released later that year on June 29.\n\nGiven the momentous occasion, rumour has it that Apple has been holding back some of its most groundbreaking features for this year's model.\n\nWe've rounded up all the latest rumours and leaks, so if you're still undecided about your next phone, you'll have a good idea what Apple has in store.\n\nLatest news\n\nSources have apparently told Apple-focused site Mac4Ever that the company is planning to launch its next iPhones on September 12.\n\nWhat's more, they believe that the new phones will be available to pre-order from Friday, September 15. They could be in store (or online) as soon as September 22.\n\nThe site reports that mobile operators have been told the date by Apple in preparation for what could be the biggest gadget launch of the year.\n\nAlthough these dates fit in with Apple's history, the information is still unconfirmed so it shouldn't be taken as gospel at the moment.\n\nThree sizes\n\nApple is rumoured to be working on three versions of its next iPhone, including a 4.7-inch iPhone 7s, a 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus and a 5.8-inch iPhone 8.\n\nWhile early reports suggested that all three models would boast identical specifications, it's looking increasingly likely that the larger iPhone 8 model will be significantly more advanced than the 7s and 7s Plus - which are expected to closely resemble the iPhone 7.\n\n(Image: iDrop news)\n\nMeanwhile, a recent report in the Wall Street Journal claimed that Apple is currently testing more than 10 different prototypes for its next smartphone.\n\nName\n\nBased on Apple's well-established \"tick-tock\" cycle, the 2017 model would be called the iPhone 7s.\n\n(Image: AppleInsider)\n\nThe tick-tock cycle refers to Apple releasing a new design every two years, and new features within the same casing on alternate years (which are usually known as \"s\" models).\n\nHowever, rumour has it that Apple is moving to a three-year cycle on major iPhone refreshes.\n\nThis, combined with the fact that next year is the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, suggests that Apple's flagship 2017 model will be a fairly major upgrade.\n\nIt seems unlikely, in that case, that Apple will opt for the name iPhone 7s - as that would downplay the upgrade. It's more likely that it will be called the iPhone 8.\n\nApple may even decide to go for something completely different - the iPhone 10 or iPhone X, to mark the anniversary, perhaps, or even the iPhone Air, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, to reflect the iPad and Apple watch lineups.\n\nAs mentioned, Apple may choose to launch lower-spec iPhone 7s and 7s Plus devices alongside its flagship device.\n\nRelease date\n\nThe iPhone 8 release date is rumoured to be the week of September 4 or September 11, 2017.\n\nApple traditionally releases its latest iPhones during the first two weeks of September, in good time for the start of the Christmas shopping season.\n\nHowever, one report hints that Apple may break with tradition this year and launch its next flagship smartphone earlier than expected.\n\nAccording to information gathered by BlueFin Research Partners and shared by Barron's Tech Trader Daily , there is \"some indication\" that Apple will start production of the iPhone 8 in June.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nIf Apple is feeling particularly nostalgic, it may opt for June 29 - the same day the first iPhone was released.\n\nMeanwhile, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a track record of leaking accurate information on Apple products, has previously claimed the iPhone 8 could be delayed until October or November, due to \"significant hardware upgrades\".\n\nApparently, Apple is struggling to integrate its Touch ID sensor into new iPhone's the display.\n\nSo while the iPhone 8 could be unveiled in September, it may not go on sale immediately, according to Kuo.\n\nHowever Carphone Warehouse have already opened their pre-registration, so if you are looking to pick up the new iPhone as soon as it's released, you can sign up for free here.\n\nPrice\n\nApple products are not exactly known for being cheap. When the company launched its 'budget' iPhone 5c in 2013, it still cost an eye-watering \u00a3469.\n\nBut the latest reports suggest that Apple's next device will be its most expensive yet, exceeding the $1,000 (\u00a3795) mark for the first time.\n\nThe price was reportedly leaked to The Fast Company by \"a source with knowledge of Apple's plans\".\n\nThe source said that Apple will be launching three devices this year - a massive 5.8-inch model (likely called the iPhone 8), a 5.5-inch model (called iPhone 7s Plus), and a 4.7-inch model (called iPhone 7s).\n\nThe iPhone 8 will reportedly have a new OLED display that will stretch across the whole front of the phone.\n\nThis is part of the reason for the high price tag, according to the source, as the OLED display will cost Apple roughly twice as much as the LCD display used in current iPhones.\n\nThe new phone is also likely to get a memory upgrade from the current iPhone 7 line, which will add to the cost of manufacturing the device.\n\nAll-glass design\n\nApple is allegedly planning a major design overhaul for the iPhone 8. The company is said to be working on an all-glass version of its iconic iPhone , for release in 2017.\n\nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo published a report in May claiming the American tech firm will completely redesign the iPhone in 2017.\n\nInstead of the aluminium casing used in the iPhone 7 , Apple will move to an all-glass enclosure.\n\n(Image: SlashLeaks)\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time Apple has used glass in its iPhones. The iPhone 4 and 4s had glass front and back panels, with a stainless steel band sandwiched between the two.\n\nHowever, these phones were plagued by durability issues, with many customers claiming their phones cracked too easily when dropped .\n\nKuo noted that some investors are concerned that glass casing would be too heavy or fail a drop test, but said he believes that a return to glass casing will not be problematic for Apple.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"Apple already uses glass casing for iPhone 4/ 4S, and non-Apple brands have also been using glass casings. We therefore think a drop test will not be problematic for glass casing,\" he wrote in his report, according to MacRumours .\n\n\"A glass casing may be slightly heavier than an aluminum one of the same thickness, but the difference is so small that the use of the thinner and lighter AMOLED panel will compensate for that.\"\n\nThe rumour has been backed up by a couple of other leaks. A source reportedly told Japanese website Nikkei that \"Foxconn has been trying glass chassis' since last year.\"\n\nThe arguments to be made for a glass smartphone include better antenna reception and more options for wireless charging.\n\nCurved OLED display\n\nAt least one of the iPhone 8 prototypes is said to feature a new cutting-edge curved OLED display with practically no bezels - similar to that used on Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge.\n\nAlthough there is no functional reason to have a curved screen, Samsung has been seeing significantly higher sales of the curved versions of its Galaxy smartphones.\n\n(Image: Martin Hajek)\n\nIn March 2016, Nikkei reported that Apple was planning to ditch LCD displays in favour of OLED screens, with the first OLED iPhone arriving in 2017.\n\nThen in April 2017, DigiTimes reported that Apple had signed a two-year deal with Samsung to supply the OLED panels.\n\nThe deal, which is rumoured to be worth $9 billion, will see Samsung shipping 70-92 million OLED panels to Apple this year, representing 30% of all iPhone devices expected to be sold in 2017.\n\nOLED displays are superior to the LCD panels currently used in Apple\u2019s iPhones because, rather than requiring a backlight, an OLED-based screen lights up individual pixels when necessary.\n\n(Image: Martin Hajek)\n\nThis translates to blacker blacks and brighter whites, lower power consumption and faster response times compared to LED displays.\n\nLike the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8, the iPhone 8's display could have a new longer aspect ratio, IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam told MacRumors.\n\nIt could also have a 4K resolution - which would make it more suitable for virtual reality applications.\n\nEnd of the Home button\n\nRumours have been swirling for some time that Apple is planning to get rid of the traditional physical Home button and replace it with a touch-sensitive digital button.\n\nThis was originally rumoured for the iPhone 7, but it's now looking likely that it will be one of the major changes coming with the iPhone 8.\n\n(Image: Marek Weidlich)\n\nA Chinese website called Storm reports that the virtual home button will have the same haptic feedback motors used in the iPhone 7 to create the illusion of a Home button, even if it's really just a flat capacitive surface.\n\nThe biggest challenge appears to be integrating the Touch ID sensor into the display, with some rumours suggesting it will get around the problem by moving the fingerprint reader to the back of the phone.\n\nIn June, mobile technology firm Qualcomm unveiled a new \"ultrasonic\" fingerprint technology that is capable of scanning through thick glass, metal and - crucially - OLED smartphone displays.\n\nThe technology works by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, which penetrate the skin of your finger and capture a precise, 3D image of your fingerprint, according to Mashable.\n\n(Image: VIVO)\n\nQualcomm already provides many of the internal components of Apple's iPhones, but the relationship between the two companies has soured in recently month, due to an ongoing lawsuit.\n\nMashable claims that Apple is unlikely to use Qualcomm's solution, but could use it as the basis for similar technology developed in-house.\n\nHowever, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 8 could ship without a TouchID fingerprint scanner at all.\n\nKuo doesn't go into any more detail about how Apple will replace TouchID, but notes that \"3D sensing for facial recognition\" will be a part of the iPhone 8, suggesting that Apple could replace fingerprint scanning with facial recognition or eye-scanning tech.\n\n(Image: VIVO)\n\nThere's one upside to Kuo's prediction; he says that because Apple won't need to bother with scanning your digits, there'll be no delay in production.\n\nLeaked renders\n\nDesigners around the world have been speculating about what Apple has planned, and one artist, Marek Weidlich , has created an intriguing concept video.\n\nWeidlich has turned the entire front of the iPhone into a screen - leaving no home button or any visible bezel.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nMeanwhile, new renders and drawings leaked by Weibo user KK appear to show an iPhone 8 with a curved screen that covers the entire front of the device.\n\nAn accompanying dimensional drawing shows that the bezel around the edge of the display is only 4mm thick, with the curved glass on either side of the screen accounting for 2.577mm of that width.\n\nThe device itself measures 137.54 x 67.54 mm, which is roughly the same size as the iPhone 7 , but the screen is 5.768 inches diagonally - almost identical to the Galaxy S8.\n\n(Image: ifanr.com)\n\nThe drawing shows a narrow earpiece at the top of the screen, with the selfie camera, microphone and other sensors on either side.\n\nThe renderings suggest that these components will all be concealed below the glass, although it is unclear how this would work in reality.\n\nOne of the renderings shows the back of the phone with a new vertical dual camera setup.\n\n(Image: ifanr.com)\n\nThe veracity of the new images can not be confirmed, but KK has on several occasions shared accurate details about previous devices, according to MacRumours .\n\nCamera\n\nThe iPhone 8 is expected the feature the same dual-lens rear camera featured on the iPhone 7 Plus. Given that Apple only unveiled its dual-lens technology in 2016, it is unlikely to make any major changes to it in 2017.\n\nHowever, if you were hoping that the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s was going to feature a dual-lens camera, you may be disappointed.\n\nKGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims that Apple's dual-camera system will remain exclusive to the larger \"Plus\" model.\n\n\"While an attractive addition for avid picture takers and professional photographers, the iPhone 7 Plus dual-camera is not a mass-market killer application yet,\" Kuo says in the note seen by Apple Insider and 9to5Mac .\n\n\"Along with its high cost (estimated at over US$30-40) and the necessity for Apple to enhance the added value of high-end iPhone models, we expect only high-end new iPhone models (30-40% of them) to have a dual-camera next year.\"\n\nHowever, Kuo thinks that Apple's next iPhone could come with a \"revolutionary\" new selfie camera that uses infrared technology to detect the location and depth of objects in its field of vision.\n\nThe 3D camera system could be used for facial recognition, iris recognition and 3D selfies. It could also be used in augmented reality mobile games, to accurately replace a character's head with that of the user, Kuo wrote in a research report seen by 9to5mac .\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe 3D system works by sending invisible infrared light signals outwards from the phone and then detecting the signals that bounce back off of objects using the 1.4 megapixel infrared receiver.\n\nKuo said that, in the future, Apple could add 3D sensing technology to its rear cameras as well, removing the need for large dual camera iris systems.\n\nSpecs\n\n(Image: Yasser Farahi)\n\nThe iPhone 8 will, more than likely, feature an A11 chip, built on ARM's highly-efficient 10nm manufacturing process, and run the next version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11.\n\nIt will come in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage options.\n\nWireless charging\n\nWireless charging has become a common feature of some Android smartphones - including Samsung's latest family of devices - although it is still a lot slower than wired charging methods.\n\n(Image: Samsung)\n\nA report in Bloomberg in January claimed that Apple was working on \"cutting edge\" wireless technology that would allow future iPhones and iPads to be placed further away from charging mats than current smartphones.\n\nThe unnamed sources said Apple was working on overcoming \"technical barriers including loss of power over distance,\" and that the technology will feature in iPhones coming out in 2017.\n\nNow pictures have been leaked on Chinese social networking site Weibo by a Foxconn employee, providing a look at the inside of Apple's OLED iPhone.\n\n(Image: Weibo/MacRumours)\n\nThe pictures show a large, central black spot, which represents the device's wireless charging coil, according to MacRumours.\n\nFacial recognition\n\nOne of the stand-out features of Samsung's latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, is facial recognition technology, allowing users to unlock their phone by simply looking at it.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nNow eagle-eyed software engineers have found evidence that the same feature could be included in Apple's iPhone 8, by scouring through the code for one of Apple's other gadgets .\n\nThe HomePod speaker is Apple's version of the Amazon Echo or Google Home and is set to be launched in December 2017.\n\nAs the speaker needs to work seamlessly with Apple's new phones, the firmware code contains references to some upcoming features that Apple fans can expect to see.\n\n(Image: Apple)\n\nRevealed on Twitter by developer Steve Troughton-Smith it appears the next iPhone will include an infrared camera that could be used to scan your face, even in the dark.\n\nIt's likely this technology will be included so users can unlock the phone just by looking at it - in a similar way to Samsung's Galaxy S8 smartphone.\n\nMeanwhile, an earlier report from Chinese-language website MoneyDJ.com , picked up by Digitimes , suggests that Apple may be planning to introduce iris recognition technology with the iPhone 8.\n\nAccording to the report, a Taiwan-based company called Xintec is to start mass producing iris-recognition chips, some of which will be embedded in the 2017 series of iPhones.\n\nWater-resistant\n\nApple's iPhone 7 is water-resistant to a depth of one metre for up to 30 minutes - a rating known as IP67, which is the same as the Apple Watch .\n\nIt therefore makes sense that Apple would carry this through to the iPhone 8.\n\nIP67 means it will survive a dip in the sink or down the loo, and it won't break if you pour a drink over it, but you probably don't want to take it swimming.\n\nColours\n\nApple's next iPhone could come in a striking \"copper gold\" colour, if new leaked photos are to be believed.\n\nThe pictures, shared on popular Chinese microblogging site Weibo, show what appears to be Apple's forthcoming iPhone 8 in three colours - white, jet black, and a new colour described as a \"champagne gold\".\n\n(Image: Mac Rumors)\n\nThe gold option is \"closer to copper\" in colour, according to Chinese website MyDrivers , which first shared the images. It also bears a close resemblance to Apple's rose gold iPhone 7 .\n\nThe pictures, which have not been verified, show the widely-rumoured vertical dual-lens rear camera, as well as a slightly elongated power button on the side of the device.\n\n(Image: Mac Rumors)\n\nIt is not clear whether the devices pictured are taken directly from the supply chain, or if they are dummy models made by non-Apple suppliers based on recent rumours.\n\nAirPods\n\nApple's next top-of-the-range iPhone could come with an accessory worth \u00a3160 in the box.\n\nAccording to a new report from analysts at JPMorgan, seen by 9to5Mac, the iPhone 8 may come bundled with a free pair of AirPods.\n\nThe wireless earphones were announced along with the iPhone 7 and went on sale just before Christmas. They currently cost \u00a3159 to buy in the Apple Store.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nThe AirPods link up to your iPhone or Apple Watch via Bluetooth. They use sensors to automatically detect when they are in your ears, and play or pause your music accordingly.\n\nThey contain a pair of microphones, so you can control your music, change the volume and check your battery life using Siri.\n\nThe AirPods deliver up to 5 hours of listening time on one charge, and come in a special case that doubles as a charger, offering more than 24 hours of listening time in total.", "source_url": "http://www.mirror.co.uk", "date": "2017-08-28", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Image Ifanr Com", "Image Martin Hajek", "Image Apple", "Image Appleinsider", "Image Marek Weidlich", "Image Rex Shutterstock", "Image Pa", "Image Vivo", "Image Yasser Farahi", "Image Samsung"], "images": ["http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article7688146.ece/ALTERNATES/s1168v/Screen-Shot-2016-04-04-at-153355.jpg", "http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10768132.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/iphone-8-render-7-and-7s-800x525.jpg", "http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10698085.ece/ALTERNATES/s1168v/Sequence-90Still006.jpg"]}, {"title": "Galaxy Note 8 trade-in for Note 7 buyers: 13 things to know", "text": "3:24 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nTurns out, Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 olive branch to original Galaxy Note 7 owners comes with a few thorns.\n\nSamsung alerted press that the company would give US Note 7 buyers a trade-in credit of up to $425 on their current phone if they purchased the Galaxy Note 8 on Samsung.com. This is the gesture CNET was hoping Samsung would make to owners of the doomed Note 7 once the Note 8 went on sale.\n\nEnlarge Image Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nBut if you were burned by the double recall after multiple units overheated and caught fire in 2016, it won't be as easy as raising your hand to get the deal. There are conditions, as there always are. For the most part, the Note 7 trade-in program fits right in to Samsung's existing program for new phones, with just one extra caveat. In fact, the last update to terms and conditions occurred August 14, more than a week before the August 23 Note 8 event.\n\nLike any trade-in agreement, it pays to read the fine print before getting started. Here are the most important things to know before making good on the Note 7 deal.\n\nSamsung's offer is only good through Samsung\n\nYou must deal directly with Samsung to get the trade-in value. Your local carrier or retailer will not offer you Samsung's deal.\n\nThe easiest way to kick-start the process is by going to Samsung's website just for Note 7 owners.\n\nIt's for US customers only and runs until September 30\n\nWe're not sure why Samsung didn't globally roll out the offer, or if the company plans to extend it to more countries in the future. What we do know is that the offer window closes September 30, 15 days after the Note 8 goes on sale (September 15).\n\nYou must prove you bought the Note 7\n\nEnlarge Image Screenshot by Jessica Dolcourt/CNET\n\nWith your:\n\nOriginal register receipt\n\nCredit card bill\n\nCarrier bill\n\nContract or lease agreement\n\nIt must be clear that the Note 7 was the device you purchased.\n\nYes, you get the Note 8 preorder gift, too!\n\nSamsung told CNET that Note 7 owners who participate in the trade-in are also eligible for the Note 8 preorder gift that Samsung is extending to anyone who buys the phone. You'll be able to choose between a wireless charger and a 256GB microSD card, or a Gear 360 camera. Either option gets you about a $200 value if you were to purchase them separately.\n\nThe bundle is a limited-time offer (until supplies run out and all that).\n\nYou may not get the full $425 trade-in value\n\n$425 is the maximum value you'll be able to get for the phone you've been using since returning your Note 7, not a blanket promise. That's because the value of devices varies. So say you've been using and entry-level Android phone when you returned your Note 7. That phone will fetch you less than the value of, say, a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.\n\nThe trade-in phone has to be in good condition\n\n\n\nAccording to Samsung, that means it:\n\nPowers on and maintains a charge\n\n\n\nYou can use it (\"has a functioning display\")\n\nHas no breaks or cracks or other visible defects that go beyond normal wear and tear\n\n\n\nIs not on a black list of any kind (e.g. isn't listed as stolen)\n\n\n\nHas Reactivation Lock, Google Factory Reset Protection, or any other anti-theft locking software disabled (you're not trying to sell someone else's phone)\n\n\n\nHas been wiped of personal information through a factory reset (you get to this from the settings menu)\n\n\n\n3:24 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nYou can't still owe money\n\nThis is really important. If the phone you're currently using isn't fully paid for, like you leased it or still owe money on an installment plan on any sort, it's not eligible. So if you financed your phone, you'll need to pony up the balance and own it outright before you can participate in Samsung's trade-in.\n\nYou have 15 days to send back your old device after getting the new one\n\nOnce Samsung sends you the shipping label and instructions, your 15-day countdown is on.\n\nThat means Samsung has to receive your phone (and not your charger, case or any extra accessory) by that deadline, and in good working condition (see above).\n\nHere's the \"or else\" if that doesn't happen:\n\nSamsung might charge you for the full amount of the agreed-upon trade-in value, which you will not get back\n\nIf it's in bad condition, Samsung will value it at $25.00 and charge you the difference\n\nSamsung will charge the same credit card or other payment method that you use to buy the Note 8 (Samsung's selling it for $930)\n\nIf you don't have enough credit, Samsung will come after you until you pay up\n\n\n\nAgain, you have to wipe the phone first\n\nThis is worth repeating, and is a no-brainer, since you don't want your personal information on there anyway. You'll find the factory reset option in the phone's settings.\n\nYou must have a Samsung account\n\nIt's free and you can create one from a Samsung phone or online here.\n\nYou will never get your other phone back\n\nSorry, them's the rules.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n\"Samsung cannot return your Trade-In Device to you, even if you return your New Samsung Device within the applicable return period.\"\n\nBut you can return the Note 8\n\nAs long as it's within the typical return window of 15 days after receiving it. Of course, you'll get your money back, too.\n\nYou have to be 18 to participate\n\nIf you're under 18, you'll need to ask a parent or guardian to help.\n\nTech Culture: From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech.\n\nSpecial Reports: All of CNET's most in-depth features in one easy spot.", "source_url": "https://www.cnet.com", "date": "None", "fake or real": "R", "authors": [], "images": ["https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/N2kVUOtoFtskroKPdJYlfjpIK6g=/88x88/2016/05/10/1691790c-3479-4db3-ab6f-a238ab9eac44/pile-of-phones-may-2016-5345-001.jpg", "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/VJU0bo7acLirJRWAhvYLyHgc2_M=/fit-in/570x0/2017/08/18/6851095f-553a-4c69-80ad-04bda44468f7/galaxy-note-8-111.jpg", "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/FYmvNmbCLCLVsEl1le3CbXnYGAk=/88x88/2017/01/24/1fe70ce4-68d2-4e07-b992-4b65d940df78/samsung-galaxy-note-7-new-nov-2nd-1067-001.jpg", "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/CUUHpvuug4cP4L-J8kSu87o5oLM=/88x88/2014/03/25/6dc680d4-03b0-4846-8d2f-8a15791261ed/jessicadolcourt.jpg", "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/Aw8QGY-yVekvDYxblHpjxOZJzfM=/88x88/2017/08/16/00d48a2b-478a-4733-9bfa-3f91ffc58a0a/essential-phone-6951-017.jpg", "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/B-Gh_iCJfrq3dpal6pEpToNKpKo=/88x88/2017/08/26/79d39f37-a63f-47e5-bb13-31f8104ecd75/359extwkndart-2.jpg", "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/iDcp6H6voUPUOdmKpkt6n-UEl8w=/770x433/2017/08/22/d81981f6-23a1-47ed-ba66-726522c1a104/note8-cnet.jpg", "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/92j-2xDkMhkdkIR1mxf5CiWAlkQ=/670x503/2017/08/25/222e3491-859f-4c08-99e6-430e5bee9574/galaxy-note-8-129.jpg", "https://www.cnet.com/bundles/cnetcss/images/core/redball/logo_192.png", "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/1bo1jCuScUTXUxawbTWMKerTp1k=/724x407/2017/08/18/8eb2396f-cc75-4284-8aee-ae2bbaf2ab95/galaxy-note-8-3555-019.jpg", "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/ioAqdVT6pnrK6Q-2UmloXXM3rK4=/300x169/2017/08/18/8eb2396f-cc75-4284-8aee-ae2bbaf2ab95/galaxy-note-8-3555-019.jpg", "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/1mpbvow_MdtfKNfW_3qV5xIoFew=/fit-in/570x0/2017/08/27/f7c42333-14a2-40a4-a31d-204d9b92e23f/2017-08-25-16-06-57.png"]}, {"title": "MTV VMAs: 13 things to know, from Kendrick Lamar\u2019s many wins to Taylor Swift\u2019s video", "text": "\n\nKendrick Lamar performs onstage during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.

(You can find a detailed breakdown here. The video is quite something.)\n\n* Jared Leto honored Chester Bennington\n\nBennington, the 41-year-old Linkin Park frontman, died last month; his death was ruled a suicide. Leto, actor and lead singer of 30 Seconds to Mars, paid tribute to his friend.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about Chester, I see his face, which was always smiling. I think about his heart, which he wore on his sleeve \u2026 at once ferocious and delicate, that voice will live forever,\u201d Leto said. \u201cIf there is anyone out there who is watching this tonight, who feels like there is no hope, hear me now.

( Saul Loeb / AP )\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump gave a speech on Aug. 21 that laid out his strategy to continue, and ultimately \u201cwin,\u201d the war in Afghanistan. But buried underneath that lead, was a clear message, intended for neither Afghanistan nor Pakistan \u2014 but for China. Despite being less overt than previous speeches, the message was simple: the U.S. plans to remain a political, economic, and perhaps even military force not just along Asia\u2019s Pacific coast, but in Asia as a whole. While his language was not nearly as blunt as the statements he made about China during last year\u2019s election campaign, Trump delivered a bold policy message. Put simply, the message was that the U.S. will \u201cfurther develop its strategic partnership with India, the world\u2019s largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States.\u201d The president also made it clear that a new partnership with India would not simply be about ending the war in Afghanistan, but would involve the pursuit of \u201cshared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.\u201d While India lags China \u2014 economically, diplomatically, and militarily \u2014 if any county in Asia is ever going to have the ability to challenge China\u2019s geopolitical dominance of the continent, it is India. While the two countries typically have a quiet rivalry, it has not always been that way. In 1962, China and India fought a brief war over a disputed border in the Himalaya mountains (the two countries came to blows again over the border issue in 1967, and Chinese and Indian soldiers are currently in a standoff over a Chinese claim on Bhutan\u2019s northern border). In 1964, China\u2019s first nuclear bomb test alarmed India, and helped solidify support in the Indian bureaucracy for their own nuclear weapon program. Today, India warily eyes China\u2019s ambitious \u201cOne Belt, One Road (OBOR)\u201d policy that envisions building a modern-day Silk Road linking central China to markets in Europe.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nWhile Beijing argues that OBOR will benefit the whole of central and southern Asia, the Indian government has raised concerns about the how the project will be managed and whether the project will skew the regional balance of power. While China\u2019s history with India may not be as bloody and bitter as its history with Japan, the stakes in some ways are much higher. Together, the two nuclear-armed countries have a population of more than 2.5 billion, and account for some 18 per cent of the global economy. The governments of both countries will be \u2014 rightly or wrongly \u2014 rewarded or held accountable for meeting or failing the economic expectations of their growing middle classes, and neither can afford to cede political dominance (and the economic benefits, such as market access, that come with it) of Asia to the other.\n\nOf course, the U.S. and India have been drifting closer together for years (see, for example, President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to allow the U.S. to sell nuclear material and technology to India). But announcing that American security relies in part on decisions made in New Delhi \u2014 while India is in the midst of a border dispute with China \u2014 verges on making political alignment with India official U.S. policy. The decision is ultimately not that surprising. On many issues China and the U.S. simply do not see eye-to-eye. These range from the potentially incendiary (China\u2019s military bases in the disputed South China Sea), to the serious-but-manageable (American accusations that China dumps manufactured goods in the U.S. market). Both India and the U.S. want to see China stop doing certain things. A partnership between the two countries may be unruly, but the basic logic is there. When taken in conjunction with last week\u2019s new sanctions on Chinese firms that the U.S. accuses of bypassing sanctions on North Korea, President Trump\u2019s endorsement of India is a strong signal that America\u2019s China policy is getting more hawkish. While President Xi and President Trump had a cordial and productive meeting this April, the tone of the Sino-American relationship has changed. While Trump may have been vague about how the U.S. is going to win the war in Afghanistan, he did send China an unmistakable message: the United States is going to attend to its interests in Asia, and China cannot expect special \u2014 or gentle \u2014 treatment.

During these communications, we were able to express our views and convey our concerns and interests.\"\n\n\"On this basis, expeditious disengagement of border personnel at the face-off site of Doklam has been agreed to and is going on,\" the statement read further.\n\nThe Doklam understanding between India and China marks a significant departure by Beijing from its earlier stated position on the standoff. China had been insisting that India must withdraw its troops from Doklam before any \"meaningful\" dialogue could be held.\n\nFor India, the Doklam deal is on the lines as stated by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in Parliament where she had suggested that the two nations could agree to withdraw troops from the standoff site on a mutually agreed time.\n\nBut, the question is what made China reconsider its position on Doklam standoff and agree to resolve the issue.\n\nTop security expert Dr Brahma Chellaney pointed out that Beijing cannot announce a mutual withdrawal from the disputed land.\n\n\"China seeks to save face by spinning mutual-withdrawal deal with India as unilateral Indian withdrawal, and PLA to continue to patrol Doklam,\" Dr Brahma Chellaney said.\n\n\"Having claimed Doklam to be its area, China cannot publicly accept mutual withdrawal. Yet, under the deal, that's precisely what it accepted,\" he added.\n\nBRICS SUMMIT IN CHINA\n\nThe BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) summit is scheduled for September 3-5 at Xiamen in China. In the view of Doklam standoff, the success of BRICS was under question. There was also speculation about Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipping the summit.\n\nChina has given utmost importance to BRICS since its inception in 2009 projecting it as an alternate economic model against those dominated by the US and the western bloc.\n\nThe theme of Xiamen BRICS summit is \"Stronger Partnership for a Brighter Future\". But Doklam standoff could have embarrassed China as it was being seen as violator of international laws at the disputed site by attempting to alter the status quo without settling the boundary question with the countries concerned.\n\nThe Xiamen BRICS summit is being held after a successful Goa edition of the group. India had played a good host only last year, China could not have afforded to appear as a belligerent member of the BRICS.\n\nDIPLOMATIC SETBACK\n\nDespite China's attempt to garner international support over Doklam, its diplomacy was no match to India's in convincing the world leaders that the communist nation was at fault in the disputed region.\n\nThe US and the UK categorically asked China to resolve the matter diplomatically and bilaterally with India. The messages from the US and the UK came at a time when China was firm on its demand that Indian troops must withdraw from Doklam first.\n\nLater, Japan was more upfront in saying that it was China which violated the international law at Doklam. Japan said that China tried to alter status quo at Doklam while suggesting that no country should try to change the existing positions without resolving the dispute.\n\nChina's effort to take Nepal along also did not yield desirable result with the Himalayan nation stating that it would prefer neutrality to taking sides over Doklam standoff.\n\nDOKLAM STRATEGICALLY UNVIABLE\n\nFor China, Doklam is strategically unviable as its troops occupied lower ground while the Indian Army held the high hills. The Chumbi Valley of Tibet is sandwiched between Sikkim and India's ally Bhutan. So, while China eyed to gain an upper hand at Doklam with the aim of acquiring strategic advantage over India's Chicken Neck, it failed on both diplomatic and strategic counts.\n\nAs Chinese spokespersons and official media aggressively targeted India, pressure was mounting on the Xi Jinping government to make a decisive move. One of the options available with China was to resort to military aggression which could have escalated to other sectors of borders. China was not in an advantageous position in Doklam and could not have afforded to escalate it on the western sector at a time when it has committed USD 46 billion in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\n\nCONGRESS OF CPC\n\nThe 19th Congress of the Communist Party of China is scheduled for later this year. Dates of the grandest CPC even in five years have not yet been announced but it is likely to be held sometime by early November.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has been working to give the party a new outlook. The polit buro and polit buro standing committee are set to be reorganied and Xi Jinping is likely to fill the posts with his proteges. Only Xi Jinping and his premier Le Kiqiang will be the old faces of the new polit buro standing committee as all other will be left out on account age.\n\nFurther, Xi Jinping is said to be keen on getting Congress' approval for an unprecedented third term in 2022. Jinping has already made the move by first getting his position elevated to that of \"core leader\" in 2016. And, early this month, he became the first Chinese leader after Mao Zedong to be addressed by the PLA soldiers as \"chairman\". Jinping could not have afforded to let Doklam remain thorn in the flesh as he unveiled his ambition before the Congress of the CPC.\n\nALSO READ |\n\nIndia-China Doklam border standoff set to end after deal on withdrawing troops\n\nWhy Doklam standoff is not good for Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of BRICS Summit, CPC Congress\n\nWhy Japan lent support to India against China over Doklam standoff\n\nDoklam border standoff set to end after India-China strike deal to withdraw troops", "source_url": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in", "date": "None", "fake or real": "R", "authors": [], "images": ["http://m4.zedo.com/log/p.gif?a=2388366;c=821002608;x=23040;n=821;e=i;i=0;s=2;z=[timestamp]", "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/swaraj_042215020128.jpg", "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/modi_042215023911.jpg", "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/1.0.4/resources/images/T.png", "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/1.0.4/resources/css/images/CloseIcon20x20.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&ac2=8549097&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://m4.zedo.com/log/p.gif?a=2520674;g=0;c=821003063;x=23040;n=821;i=0;e=i;s=2;z=[timestamp]", "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/resources/images/defaultauthor-img.gif", "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/modi-jinping-reuters-story_647_082817014443.jpg"]}, {"title": "Conditions like those inside Neptune cause diamond formation", "text": "Carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen are some of the easiest heavier elements to form through fusion. As a result, they're common in our Solar System, typically found combined with hydrogen to make ammonia, water, and methane. In the gas and ice giants of the outer Solar System, however, these chemicals are placed under extreme pressures, where chemistry starts to get a bit weird. Do these chemicals survive the crushing interiors of these planets?\n\nOne intriguing idea is that methane doesn't survive. As pressure and temperature increase, methane should start condensing into more complex hydrocarbons. Then, as pressures increase further, calculations indicate the hydrogen and carbon should separate out, leaving pure carbon to sink to the depths of these planets. As a result, it's been hypothesized that, close to their core, planets like Neptune and Uranus have a layer of pure diamond.\n\nWhile some evidence supporting this theory has surfaced over the years, it's been hard to precisely replicate the temperatures and pressures found inside the planets. Now, new work done at the SLAC X-ray laser facility supports the idea that these planets are full of diamonds. But the work indicates the diamonds only form at greater depths than we'd previously thought.\n\nThe conditions inside places like Neptune have been mimicked in a number of ways. Compressing and heating methane is easy when you use lasers or accelerate samples of the gas into collisions. But mimicry seldom got the conditions just right; when pressures were high enough, the temperatures were often unrealistically high. And the relevant conditions only persist for a fraction of a second, making it hard to tell what chemicals are being formed.\n\nAn alternative is diamond anvil cells, which crush small samples between two diamonds. Here, it's possible to control the temperatures and pressures well. But one of the components of methane\u2014the hydrogen\u2014can diffuse through diamond at the relevant pressures. Removing the hydrogen may unnaturally increase the probability that diamonds can form.\n\nA large international research team figured out how to solve all of these issues. They used lasers to heat and compress a sample of hydrocarbon (polystyrene) using a two-stage process. The first blast of laser would heat and compress the sample, while a second would greatly accelerate the compression without raising the temperature as much as earlier attempts. This led to conditions that are similar to what you'd expect to see 10,000km beneath the surface of Neptune, or about 40 percent of the way down to its core. (That means pressures of about 150 Gigapascal and temperatures below 6,000 Kelvin.)\n\nMonitoring what happens under these conditions is why the experiment was performed at the SLAC facility. SLAC uses an electron accelerator to generate multiple short, intense pulses of X-rays in quick succession. That allows the molecular details of a sample to be probed every few nanoseconds using X-ray diffraction. Essentially, you can make a molecular movie of a tiny sample, with frames separated by a fraction of a nanosecond.\n\nIn these experiments, the initial laser pulse vaporized the aluminum frame holding the polystyrene, but some signals from the aluminum persisted out to about 7.5 nanoseconds. The polystyrene was transformed into a compressed hydrocarbon liquid. As the second laser pulse arrived (six nanoseconds after the first), a new signal started to appear: compressed diamond. This stuck around until about 10 nanoseconds, after which it started to be replaced by uncompressed diamond, indicating that the compressed sample had rebounded outward.\n\nWhile it didn't have time to happen in this sample, the formation of diamond would liberate hydrogen, which would be able to escape upwards to areas of lower pressure. The diamond, over time, would sink downward, essentially precipitating out of the hydrocarbon soup.\n\nThis has some major implications for planetary interiors. To begin with, layers of diamond wouldn't engage in the sort of convection that carries heat around through the liquid and gas layers of these planets. This should mean that more of the initial heat of gravitational collapse is trapped in the core of the planet. It also means that planets rich in hydrocarbons will experience a sudden change once they become large enough for diamond formation in the interior, which will alter how the planet's radius grows with its mass.\n\nIn addition to all that, the authors note that, should you be in need of a source of nanometer-sized diamonds, they know just how to make them.\n\nNature Astronomy, 2017.

The modified Peacekeeper motors launched Saturday were originally built in the 1980s and put on alert in a missile silo ready to hurl nuclear warheads to distant targets.\n\nThe Air Force phased out the Peacekeeper in 2005 in favor of the Minuteman missile, leaving the leftover rocket stages available for satellite launches.\n\nTwo commercial Orion 38 rocket motors built by Orbital ATK did the extra lifting needed to reach a unique orbit hugging the equator, an unusual perch required for the ORS-5 satellite to conduct its space surveillance mission.\n\nTwo Prometheus CubeSat secondary payloads for Los Alamos National Laboratory and a CubeSat for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, deployed from the rocket after an on-target fourth stage burn that reached a preliminary parking orbit ranging in altitude between 248 and 372 miles (400 to 600 kilometers).\n\nThe fourth stage firing put the rocket in an orbit tilted around 24.5 degrees to the equator. A final rocket burn redirected the ORS-5 satellite into an orbit that stays above the equator.\n\nThe military\u2019s ORS-5 satellite, roughly the size of a coffee table, deployed from the Minotaur upper stage around 28-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.\n\nOrbital ATK, the Minotaur 4 rocket\u2019s commercial operator, confirmed the upper stage injected the ORS-5 payload into an orbit between 372 and 375 miles (599 to 604 kilometers), very near prelaunch predictions.\n\nGround controllers contacted the ORS-5 satellite a few minutes after separation from the rocket, verifying the spacecraft was healthy and stable to begin its three-year mission.\n\nOrbital ATK declared the launch a success, giving the Minotaur rocket family a 16-for-16 record in satellite deployment missions since 2000. Counting suborbital Minotaur flights, the program has launched 26 times.\n\nSaturday\u2019s launch was the first time a Minotaur rocket took off from Cape Canaveral. All Previous flights were based off launch pads in California, Virginia and Alaska.\n\n\u201cThis was our first Minotaur launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, demonstrating the rocket\u2019s capability to launch from all four major U.S. spaceports,\u201d said Rich Straka, vice president and general manager of Orbital ATK\u2019s launch vehicles division. \u201cWith a perfect track record of 26 successful launches, the Minotaur family has proven to be a valuable and reliable asset for the Department of Defense.\u201d\n\nThe $87.5 million ORS-5 mission is the latest in a line of relatively low-cost military projects managed by the military\u2019s Operationally Responsive Space office at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. Previous ORS missions have tested plug-and-play satellite technology, deployed experimental imaging and data relay satellites, and demonstrated an autonomous rocket destruct mechanism now used on commercial launchers.\n\n\u201cThe capabilities ORS-5 brings to the nation are ushering in a new era of faster, cheaper satellite development,\u201d said Lt. Gen. John Thompson, commander of the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center. \u201cORS-5 will deliver global, persistent, optical tracking of satellites in geosynchronous orbit, enabling the nation to have increased global situational awareness of space objects.\u201d\n\nAir Force Col. Shahnaz Punjani, director of the ORS office, compared the ORS-5 satellite\u2019s function to the A-10 attack jet, an aircraft that carries a powerful armor-piercing cannon.\n\n\u201cWhen people talk about the A-10 aircraft, (they say) it\u2019s really a gun with an airplane wrapped around it,\u201d Punjani said. \u201cIn this case, the ORS-5 satellite is essentially a telescope in low Earth orbit with a spacecraft wrapped around it, looking at the geosynchronous belt.\u201d\n\nAnother way to look at it is to compare the ORS-5 satellite to an airport radar, said Grant Stokes, head of the space systems and technology division of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Lincoln Laboratory, where the spacecraft was developed and manufactured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of analogous to a surveillance radar at an airport, which goes around and around, surveilling the domain,\u201d Stokes told reporters in a prelaunch briefing Thursday. \u201cOnce per orbit, what ORS-5 will do is scan the GEO (geosynchronous) belt and keep track, essentially, of all the items there.\n\n\u201cThe GEO belt is particularly important,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge collection of satellites there, and a tremendous amount of economic value in that special orbit, so it is one that generally we want to keep fairly good tabs on what\u2019s there and where things are.\u201d\n\nSatellites in geosynchronous orbit nearly 22,300 miles (35,800 kilometers) above the equator fly around Earth at the same rate the planet rotates. The effect at that altitude keeps satellites over the same geographic position at all times.\n\nDesigned for a three-year mission, ORS-5 should feed military officials data on how objects are moving around geosynchronous orbit. After identifying which objects might be threats, the Air Force could task the more capable SBSS Block 10 satellite to take better pictures, or send one of the military\u2019s four close-up inspection satellites in geosynchronous orbit to take a closer look, according to Lt. Col. Heather Bogstie, ORS-5 program manager.\n\nThe data output from ORS-5 \u201cgives you dots on a screen,\u201d Stokes said.\n\n\u201cWe very carefully measure how bright they are, but it does not resolve in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dot at a distance of something like 40,000 kilometers (nearly 25,000 miles).\u201d\n\nPunjani said the ORS-5 satellite is a \u201cchange detection agent\u201d to collect imagery of broad swaths of space. In keeping with the ORS program\u2019s low-cost ethos, the ORS-5 mission was conceived to meet minimum standards required by the military\u2019s space surveillance division, without the bells and whistles on more expensive spacecraft.\n\nThe SBSS Block 10 satellite launched in September 2010 cost more than $800 million, around 10 times more than ORS-5.\n\nSBSS Block 10 will exceed its seven-year design life later this year, and a full-up replacement satellite is not expected to launch until at least 2021. ORS-5 will fill the potential gap in tracking coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at how ORS builds our satellites, we\u2019re going to go small,\u201d Punjani said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to threshold requirements, and then we\u2019re going to hold to those requirements and not change those requirements throughout the life cycle, in order to ensure we rapidly acquire these programs. This program was done within three years, compared to other satellite programs that have a five-to-ten year life cycle.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force said the ORS-5 satellite itself cost around $49 million. Another $27.2 million went toward purchasing the Minotaur 4 launch from Orbital ATK, the rocket\u2019s commercial operator, and ground systems cost $11.3 million.\n\nThe military needed a dedicated rocket for the ORS-5 mission because of its unique orbit directly over the equator. That type of orbit required the Air Force and Orbital ATK to base the launch from Cape Canaveral instead of from an already-used Minotaur pad at Wallops Island, Virginia.\n\nOfficials looked at several launch options, including building a temporary Minotaur launch pad at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, or at the European-run Guiana Space Center in South America.\n\nThe cheapest and least risky option ended up being an uprated Minotaur 4 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe Minotaur 4 usually comes with four stages, but the ORS-5 satellite\u2019s equator-hugging orbit needed another boost. Instead of flying with a single Orion 38 rocket motor on top of the Peacekeeper missile stack, Saturday\u2019s predawn launch carried two Orion 38 stages.\n\nIt was a case of necessity breeding invention, officials said.\n\nThe Minotaur 4 launched from Complex 46, a pad originally constructed for the U.S. Navy\u2019s Trident missile program, then upgraded to support two Athena rocket launches in 1998 and 1999 for NASA and Taiwan. Space Florida, an arm of the state government, paid $6.6 million to refurbish the launch pad for the ORS-5 mission and future launch opportunities, according to Jim Kuzma, Space Florida\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\nAnother launch from pad 46 using Peacekeeper rocket motors is scheduled in late 2019 for a suborbital in-flight abort test of NASA\u2019s Orion crew capsule.\n\nEmail the author.\n\nFollow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.", "source_url": "https://spaceflightnow.com", "date": "2017-08-26", "fake or real": "R", "authors": [], "images": ["https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/03193240/SFN-Logo-Blue1.png", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/27134532/20170827-Harvey-ISS-feature-80x60.jpg", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/25125814/511743-078D.jpg", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/26175201/21077584_10155462745400479_6959828054127933132_n-2.jpg", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/28024206/DIEdLLFXkAE8MDR-80x60.jpg", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/26023715/DHwdVUkVoAAN_E8.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/27193953/DF1fGRhXUAArgrZ-80x60.jpg", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/26175201/21077584_10155462745400479_6959828054127933132_n-2-80x60.jpg", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/26083903/minotaur4_ors5_vid-80x60.png", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18035508/fregat_ses15_burn1-326x245.png", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/03180555/17williams-326x245.jpg", "https://assets.cdn.spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/03182855/17180843625_6e6c7faec0_o-326x245.jpg"]}, {"title": "Forty years on, Voyager still hurtles through space", "text": "Artist's concept of NASA's Voyager spacecraft. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech Are we alone? Forty years ago, NASA rocket scientists sought to answer this question by launching the Voyager spacecraft, twin unmanned spaceships that would travel further than any human-made object in history.\n\nThey are still traveling.\n\nWhen Voyager 1 and 2 launched about two weeks apart in 1977 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, scientists knew little about the outer planets in our solar system, and could hardly imagine the scope of their upcoming space odyssey.\n\n\"None of us knew, when we launched 40 years ago, that anything would still be working, and continuing on this pioneering journey,\" said Voyager project scientist Ed Stone.\n\nVoyager's main mission was to explore other planets including Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, but it also carried the story of humanity into deep space.\n\nOn board each Voyager is a golden record\u2014and record player\u2014that is built to last one billion years or more and contains key information about humanity and life on planet Earth, in case of an alien encounter.\n\nThe sounds include the calls of humpback whales, the Chuck Berry song \"Johnny B. Goode,\" Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, a Japanese shakuhachi (a type of flute), a Pygmy girls' initiation song, and greetings in 55 languages.\n\nLate American astronomer Carl Sagan, one of the lead scientists involved with the project, also asked his son, Nick, who is now 46, to record his voice on it.\n\n\"Hello, from the children of planet Earth,\" says the young American boy.\n\nA total of 115 images are encoded in analog form, including the Great Wall of China, telescopes, sunsets, elephants, Jane Goodall with chimps, an airport, a train, a breastfeeding mother, dolphins and images of the human sex organs.\n\nExploring other worlds\n\nVoyager 2 launched first, on August 20, 1977, followed by Voyager 1 on September 5 on a faster, shorter trajectory that would eventually take it into the lead.\n\nThe timing of the mission took advantage of a rare planetary alignment that only happens every 175 years, along with \"gravity-assist\" boosts from passing by planets that minimized the fuel needed.\n\nBut Voyager faced many challenges from the start, from tight budgets to the limits of modern technology in the 1970s.\n\nOne project scientist famously recalled wrapping Voyager's cables in aluminum foil\u2014the store-bought kind for kitchen use\u2014to protect the spacecraft from frying in heavy radiation.\n\nThen-president Richard Nixon wanted to contain the mission to a two-planet flyby and a five-year life, but scientists building Voyager planned for a longer mission just in case.\n\nThe cosmic duo went on to unveil planetary features unlike anything ever seen, including details about the surface of Jupiter with its raging storm the size of two Earths, known as the Great Red Spot.\n\n\"These were, at that point, better pictures than any ground-based telescopes could provide,\" said Alan Cummings, a senior research scientist at Caltech who worked on the project beginning in 1973.\n\nThe Voyager mission also discovered the first active volcanoes beyond Earth on Jupiter's moon Io, and signs of a subsurface ocean on Jupiter's moon Europa.\n\nSaturn's moon, Titan, turned out to have the most Earth-like atmosphere in the solar system, while Neptune's moon Triton was revealed to be spewing icy geysers.\n\nThis handout photograph from Sept. 5, 1977 shows the launch of NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft from NASA's Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida\n\n'Cherish that blue dot'\n\nAstronomy textbooks were rewritten on a wide scale, thanks to Voyager, which zoomed past Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus and \"revolutionized the science of planetary astronomy,\" NASA said in an online remembrance of the famed mission.\n\nWhen Voyager had no more planets to be encountered on its trajectory, Carl Sagan pressed to have its cameras turn back toward Earth for a final snap of the planet that sent it.\n\nFrom four billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers) away, the images were taken on Valentine's Day, 1990.\n\nThe Earth appeared as tiny as a speck of dust in a sunbeam, less than a single pixel in the vastness of space.\n\n\"I think this perspective underscores our responsibility to preserve and cherish that blue dot, the only home we have,\" Sagan told a press conference at the time.\n\nNASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft gave its first glimpse of Neptune and its moon Triton in 1989. This picture of Neptune obtained in August 2014 was produced from the last whole planet images taken through the green and orange filters on the Voyager 2 narrow angle camera\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nVoyager 1 has traveled father than any human-made spacecraft, and made it to interstellar space, about 13 billion miles away from Earth, in August 2012.\n\nVoyager 2 is on its way there too, and is the only spacecraft to have flown by all four outer planets in our solar system.\n\nThe plutonium-powered spaceships will continue until they finally run out of fuel, and will then orbit in the center of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nCummings said the cameras stopped working a long time ago, but about five instruments still collect data.\n\nScientists still hear from the Voyager spacecraft daily, and expect to get data for about another decade.\n\n\"It is still discovering new things because it is going where nothing has been before,\" said Stone.\n\nExplore further: NASA: let's say something

morning with this.....there is a possibility that the next 48 hours may not be as bad as originally thought. That's not to say there won't be rounds of heavy rain throughout the Houston area, but the new forecast track for Harvey brings the storm ashore much further to the east.\n\nHouston is still well within the \"cone of uncertainty\" and even if the track holds, don't expect flood waters to disappear anytime soon. Most of the metro area will see another six inches or more of rain in the next two days, on top of the 24-30 inches we've already seen. However, previous forecasts called for another 15-30 inches of rain.\n\nRescue operations will begin again in earnest as daylight emerges in the Houston area. All local school system are closed for the day and most will be closed for the week as thousands are flooded out of their homes.\n\nDo not attempt to drive through flooded roadways. Most major roads in and around Houston are at least partially water covered, some with as much as 10 feet of water.\n\nResidents along the Barker and Addicks Reservoirs are being asked as part of a non-mandatory evacuation to leave their homes Monday as the Corps of Engineers began a slow, controlled release of water overnight from the reservoirs. Officials stress to leave their homes Monday and NOT tonight due to uncertain conditions on the roads. This will impact several thousand homes. If they don't release water now, the rising water situation could put too much pressure on the dams.\n\n\n\nThe water release from Addicks Reservoir will begin at 2 a.m. Monday with Barker to follow 24 hours later.\n\nCLICK HERE to view the maps showing impacted homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the hardest hit areas was in Dickinson.

RONEN ZVULUN/REUTERS\n\nAll member nations of the UN are independent and define their positions based on their own values, Guterres said. As secretary general, he had a be \"an honest broker\" and treat all the same, and he will continue to do so, Guterres said.\n\nGuterres told Netanyahu, \"As secretary general of the United Nations, I am totally committed to be ... adamant\" in regards to Israel's right to exist.\n\nThe secretary general recalled his previous role in the peace process, mentioning a four-hour meeting meeting he had hosted as the prime minister of Portugal between the deputy Israeli prime minister at the time, Shimon Peres, and the head of the Palestinian Authority, Yasir Arafat, under the Ariel Sharon government. At the time, that meeting was secret. He said that, at that meeting, he had both witnessed \"the commitment for peace and the difficulties of that commitment.\"\n\n\"I have always had a dream that I would be able to see in the Holy Land,\" Guterres said, \"in which Jerusalem is clearly a city linked \u2013 deeply linked \u2013 to three religions ... two states living together, in mutual recognition, but also in peace and security.\n\nSpeaking at the his residence in Jerusalem in his meeting with Guterres, Rivlin called on Guterres to take steps against the discrimination against Israel at the UN. The president said: \"This targeting of Israel, this singling out of the world's only Jewish state, and even actions and statements that threaten to destroy Israel are unacceptable and should come at a price. No member state in the UN should be allowed to behave like that. These actions weaken cooperation between states and are against the rule of law.\"\n\nWelcoming Guterres, Rivlin said: \"The UN makes it possible for nation states to work together as equals, for the sake of all humanity. No one understands this better than us, Israelis.\"succeed and that there will be respect for all countries.\"\n\nIn response, Guterres said in his remarks, \"I started my visit in your beautiful country with a very moving visit at Yad Vashem. This important place reminds all of us that the Holocaust occurred not so very long ago and that we are continuing to witness expressions of anti-Semitism around the world by means of discrimination and persecution. Yad Vashem is a reminder to all of us that we must position ourselves as spearheads in the struggle against anti-Semitism and against all forms of racism, whatever they may be. A reminder that we must all promote understanding and dialogue. I am deeply appreciative of your obligation to this, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"I want to promise you, Mr. President,\" Guterres continued, \"that in my term of office I intend to emphasize the principles of equality and objectivity which we are obligated to, among all of the member states of the United Nations.\n\n\"I believe that the calls for destroying Israel which you, Mr. President, spoke of,\" the UN chief added, \"constitute modern anti-Semitism. But I am certain that you understand that sometimes there are between us and between the government of Israel differences of opinions, as happens with other governments. I know that we will always be very honest in the dialogue with the State of Israel and in our efforts to find a peaceful path in the region, while at the same time we will continue to ensure that anti-Semitism will not succeed and that there will be respect for all countries.\"\n\nGuterres arrived in Israel Sunday night on his first official visit. He met with U.S. envoy Jason Greenblatt and discussed the situation in the Gaza Strip, as well as possibilities to promote the peace process.\n\nGuterres will also meet the families of soldiers missing in action in Gaza, although he is not expected to play a role in resolving this issue since he has no contact with Hamas and is not expected to meet its officials. Nevertheless, Israeli sources say he could indirectly pressure Hamas by appealing to Qatar and Egypt. Rivlin brought the matter up to the secretary general: \"Hamas in Gaza must not be allowed to rebuild their weapons, and the world must call on Hamas, to return our sons. Return them home. To their families. I urge you to take this mission and to help us bring back our sons.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, Guterres visited Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial, and laid a wreath in the Hall of Remembrance. Guterres was joined by Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, who was elected to be the vice president of the General Assembly's 72nd session beginning in September. Dannon told the secretary general: \"In these days when we witness shocking and dangerous manifestations of anti-Semitism, the entire world must stand up to anti-Semitism and condemn it.\"\n\nOn his first visit to the country since assuming his position at the head of the United Nations in January, the Portuguese-born academic and politician is scheduled to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday.

Catholic authorities in Myanmar and the Vatican said on Monday Aug. 28, 2017 that Pope Francis will visit Myanmar and Bangladesh starting at the end of November. (Tony Gentile/Pool Photo via AP, File) (Associated Press)\n\nYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 Catholic authorities in Myanmar and the Vatican announced Monday that Pope Francis will visit Myanmar and Bangladesh starting at the end of November.\n\nThe announcement by the Vatican\u2019s press office said the pope will visit the cities of Yangon and Naypyitaw, the capital, during his Nov. 27-30 trip to Myanmar, and Dhaka during his Nov. 30-Dec. 2 visit to Bangladesh.\n\nIt will be the first trip by a pope to Myanmar, which is predominantly Buddhist. Pope John Paul II in 1986 visited Bangladesh, a mainly Muslim country.\n\nThe pope\u2019s visit to Myanmar comes at a delicate time, with communal tensions between the Buddhist majority and the Muslim Rohingya ethnic majority flaring last week with clashes between the army and Rohingya insurgents. Advocates from the Rohingya say the army is attacking Rohingya villages and driving thousands to flee.\n\nPrejudice against the Rohingya is widespread and longstanding, and has been behind previous large-scale violence. There are about 1 million Rohingya in the western state of Rakhine, but they are treated as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denied citizenship.\n\nOn Sunday, Pope Francis decried persecution of the Rohingya and prayed that they receive \u201cfull rights.\u201d He referred to \u201csad news about the persecution of the religious minority of our Rohingya brothers\u201d and asked the faithful in St. Peter\u2019s Square to pray that God \u201csaves them\u201d and they receive help.\n\nHe has expressed his concern for the Rohingya on several previous occasions.\n\nThe pope is likely to receive criticism from several sides for his plan to visit Myanmar. Advocates for the Rohingya may feel his visit lends legitimacy to a government some believe is committing genocide, while the vocal Buddhist nationalist community that feels the Rohingya don\u2019t belong in the country will be unhappy with his sympathy for them.\n\nThe announcement of the visit by the Catholic bishops of Myanmar said the government there \u201chas extended a warm welcome with the invitation to the Holy Father, hoping his presence will further peace and harmony of all people.\u201d It said he will meet government leaders along with youth, civil society and religious leaders, in addition to discharging pastoral duties for the local Catholic community.\n\nThe Vatican and Myanmar in May agreed to establish diplomatic relations, making the announcement on the same day that the pope met with Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, the country\u2019s top civilian leader.\n\nThe Vatican in its announcement said the motto of the pope\u2019s trip to Myanmar is love and peace, reflecting the pope\u2019s intention to promote both during his visit.\n\n\u201cThe common ground of Christianity and Buddhism is love,\u201d the Vatican said. \u201cIt is this concept that creates mutual respect and acceptance between the Christians and the Buddhists.\u201d\n\nThe theme of the visit to Bangladesh will be peace and harmony \u201camong religions, cultures, peoples, society, history, heritage and traditions,\u201d the Vatican said.\n\nThe peace part of the motto refers to \u201cpeace experienced, as well as aspired in future with a vision of integrated human and spiritual development in Bangladesh,\u201d it said.\n\nBangladesh has been troubled by political instability and a nascent jihadist movement.\n\nThere are about 600,000 Catholics in Myanmar, roughly 1 percent of the 58 million population, while Bangladesh\u2019s Catholic community numbers about 280,000, less than a quarter of one percent of a population estimated to be as much as 150 million.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Frances D\u2019Emilio in Rome contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Health Minister Lucrecia Hernandez Mack and a top economic adviser, Quique Godoy, also resigned.\n\nIn ordering Mr. Vel\u00e1squez out, Mr. Morales is also defying the United Nations and the United States, which have repeatedly supported the prosecutor\u2019s decision to focus the panel\u2019s work on tackling corruption.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say this is a constitutional crisis of the gravest proportions,\u201d Eric L. Olson, a Guatemala expert at the Wilson Center in Washington, wrote in an email, suggesting that Guatemala\u2019s fragile institutions may be unable to withstand the rupture. \u201cThe train is veering off the tracks, and it\u2019s not clear who will stop it.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that he was \u201cshocked\u201d to hear Mr. Vel\u00e1squez had been ordered expelled and that he expected the Guatemalan authorities to treat him \u201cwith the respect due to his functions as an international civil servant.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Fernando Carrera, a former foreign minister, said that Mr. Morales\u2019s order reflected \u201cjust how lost he is in terms of analyzing the power in Guatemala right now\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s going to find out he hasn\u2019t got as much power as he thinks he does.\u201d\n\nThe anticorruption panel, Mr. Carrera said, \u201chas all the power right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress, the media, civil society, political groups are against him,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Constitutional Court will put limits on his authoritarian position.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, an investigation by Mr. Vel\u00e1squez and Ms. Aldana into a customs fraud conspiracy led to the fall of President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, who resigned after 20 weeks of relentless street protests that displayed remarkable power by outraged citizens.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. P\u00e9rez Molina\u2019s support peeled away at the end of his term, and he is now in jail, fighting a slate of corruption charges related to the customs scheme and other actions under his government.\n\nWhether Guatemalans will flood the central square with the same determination to hold Mr. Morales to account is uncertain, but the reaction was quick from supporters of the anticorruption battle.\n\n\u201cThe same sensation as in the old days of the coups d\u2019\u00e9tat,\u201d the prominent journalist Juan Luis Font wrote on Twitter.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou commit crimes and you blow up one of those who is investigating,\u201d wrote Gabriel Wer, one of the organizers of the protest movement in 2015. \u201cWherever you look, this is unacceptable.

And at first, Mr. Morales appeared to support the changes, particularly a judicial overhaul that was to be their centerpiece.\n\nBut the effort sputtered as opposition gathered force. Legislators, who are beholden more to donors than to political parties, passed a few laws but watered them down.\n\nThe judicial overhaul foundered in Congress. And the powerful business community, which had declared that it was time for an end to corruption, pushed back when new corruption cases swept up the owners of powerful companies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Mr. Vel\u00e1squez and Ms. Aldana announced an investigation that implicated the president\u2019s son and brother in a scheme to falsify receipts, Mr. Morales stopped cooperating with the anticorruption commission, although he did not try then to block the investigation.\n\nThe 10-year-old United Nations panel, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, known by its Spanish initials as Cicig, has been at the heart of the effort to strengthen Guatemala\u2019s rule of law. Its international prosecutors work alongside members of the attorney general\u2019s office, giving Guatemalan prosecutors the support to take on cases against powerful figures who would have walked free in the past.\n\nWithout a strong ally at the head of commission, Ms. Aldana \u2014 who has said she would resign if Mr. Vel\u00e1squez is expelled \u2014 or her successor would take the central role in anticorruption cases.\n\nAs rumors swirled this past week that Mr. Morales might seek to remove Mr. Vel\u00e1squez, social media erupted in the prosecutors\u2019 defense. Many Guatemalans, including some of the president\u2019s subordinates, have said there is no going back.\n\nAmong them is Juan Francisco Sol\u00f3rzano Foppa. Born to leftist guerrilla parents who fought in the country\u2019s civil war, Mr. Sol\u00f3rzano Foppa is a different sort of revolutionary: He is Guatemala\u2019s tax collector.\n\n\u201cI feel that there are a lot of people with the desire to make changes,\u201d he said, speaking before the expulsion order on Sunday. \u201cI think that is possibly the biggest \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the legacy or the biggest lesson \u2014 of 2015 and the protests in the plaza. I think that people lost the fear of expressing themselves and saying what they think freely.\u201d\n\nMr. Sol\u00f3rzano Foppa, 34, came to the tax agency last year from the attorney general\u2019s office, where as the director of criminal analysis he helped prepare the customs fraud case that ensnared Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina, the former president.\n\nIn an interview before the Sunday order expelling him, Mr. Vel\u00e1squez warned that the work he and Ms. Aldana had done was under threat. \u201cI think we are still at very grave risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the rules of the game don\u2019t change, then the fight against corruption will not bear fruit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd he suggested that his investigations could reach to the top of Guatemala\u2019s power structure. He recalled how some business leaders had come to see him to argue that his corruption fight would hurt economic growth.\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s enough\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s what they say,\u201d he said, describing the conversations. \u201c\u2018We have learned.

The latest DeutschlandTrend survey put the CDU and its Bavarian sister party CSU ahead with 38 percent, while the SPD trailed at 22 percent.\n\nSince announcing the former European Parliament president's candidacy for chancellor, the SPD has struggled to make gains on Merkel's CDU. But Schulz warned that Merkel has \"no plan at all\" to deal with key issues such as pollution caused by diesel emissions, which affects cities like Stuttgart.\n\nGerman election campaign placards Christian Democratic Union (CDU) After three terms in office, Chancellor Angela Merkel is no stranger to election posters. With a budget of 20 million euros, the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is pinning up some 22,000 placards across Germany. The use of a deconstructed German flag brings out the party's patriotism, while the main focus of slogans is on issues such a security, family and work.\n\nGerman election campaign placards Social Democrats (SPD) The Social Democrats are keeping it classic with their long-time red, square logo. Posters concentrate on topics such as education, family, pension, investment and wage inequality. At the end of their 24-million-euro campaign, the SPD is planning a final crusade ahead of election day, which still remains under wraps.\n\nGerman election campaign placards Free Democratic Party (FDP) More than 5 million euros have been spent on the liberal FDP's poster campaign. With their black and white photoshoot, the FDP have gone for thoroughly modern marketing, with one man at the center: Christian Lindner. Voters, however, will have a hard time reading the text heavy posters. \"Impatience is also a virtue,\" reads the slogan.\n\nGerman election campaign placards The Green Party The Greens have remained faithful to their cause and focused on classic topics such as the environment, integration and peace. \"Environment isn't everything. But without the environment, everything is nothing,\" says the slogan. A mainstay on all of the posters is the party's sunflower logo.\n\nGerman election campaign placards Alternative for Germany (AfD) The prize for most controversial placards goes, without doubt, to the right-wing AfD. From afar, the poster showing a smiling, pregnant woman seems innocent until the slogan becomes legible: \"New Germans? We make them ourselves.\" In another poster, set against the background image of three bikini-clad women, the AfD asks: \"Burkas? We like bikinis.\"\n\nGerman election campaign placards The Left Party The Left party have certainly given their best to use as many fonts as possible. In a combination of font and wordplay, this slogan one reads: \"[Colorful] People. Decisively against right-wing hate.\" Affordable rents, fairer pensions and an end to arms exports are the main issues for the leftist party. Author: Kate Brady\n\n\n\n'Stagnation and political agony'\n\nSchulz said that Merkel's behavior reminded him of the way former Chancellor Helmut Kohl lost touch with voters during his fourth term in the late 1990s.\n\n\"The last four years of the Kohl era were a period of stagnation and political agony. I want to spare Germany that again,\" Schulz said.\n\nMerkel, who avoided making jabs at the SPD challenger during a Sunday interview with ZDF, is seeking a fourth term as chancellor.\n\nRead more: What the terms 'right' and 'left' mean in the German election\n\nAccording to the latest polls, both parties are expected to fall short of an outright majority.

Harvey shut down the ports of Corpus Christi and Houston in Texas, and both are major fuel export ports.\n\n\"Any hiccup in U.S. refined product exports is highly disruptive to the supply chain given the dependency of nations like Mexico and other Latin American countries on the U.S.,\" said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\n\"The reliance on U.S. products is particularly key this year given that many refineries in Central and South America are running at abysmal levels.\"\n\nLatin American countries such as Mexico and Venezuela have become increasingly reliant on imports because they have failed to invest in expanding refineries to keep up with rising demand.\n\nThe U.S. exported 2.49 million barrels per day (bpd) of refined products and 100,000 bpd of crude to Latin America in the first quarter, according to the Energy Information Administration. Over 950,000 bpd ended up in Mexico - the biggest overseas market for American-made fuel.\n\nMexico depends on U.S. fuel to meet nearly three quarters of its domestic gasoline demand.\n\nA spokesperson for Mexican national oil company Pemex said its gasoline and diesel inventories were sufficient to make up any shortfall in supply Harvey may trigger.\n\n\u201cNew shipments via safe routes are on the way (to Mexico) and left on time from the southern Untied States before the hurricane arrived,\u201d he said.\n\nHe did not detail the volumes Mexico holds in stockpiles or how many days of demand could be covered with emergency supplies.\n\nAside from waterborne shipments, the United States also sends supplies to Mexico via rail and road, but those flows have been hit too.\n\nUnion Pacific Corp, the no. 1 U.S. railroad, said it was moving rail cars in yards prone to flooding to high elevations and would curtail trains operating through areas likely to be hit by excessive winds and rain that will impact operations.\n\nSerious disruption to global oil supplies could trigger a coordinated international release from the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA). The IEA has previously released emergency supplies to cushion the impact of natural disasters and war on international energy supplies.\n\nIt is unclear when the port of Houston will reopen as Harvey is forecast to move closer to the area in coming days, dumping torrential rain. The port of Corpus Christi suffered minor infrastructure damages but was making preparations to restart, a spokeswoman said on Sunday.\n\nEUROPE\n\nFuel supplies to Europe will also be disrupted by the storm. The United States is the biggest source of ultra low sulfur diesel to Europe and Latin America.\n\nLatin American countries such as Mexico will need to seek diesel supplies from Asia and the U.S. West Coast, traders said.\n\n\"They will have to pay high,\" said one trader of distillates, a group of fuels that includes diesel and jet fuel.\n\nEurope would be the most likely source of more gasoline for Latin America, said Vikas Dwivedi, global oil and gas strategist at Macquarie.\n\n\"If there are a lot of shutdowns, whatever capacity is running will get consumed in the U.S., it will have to be, so Latin America will have to get its barrels from elsewhere. It creates a domino effect,\" Dwivedi said.\n\nHarvey's effect on the prices of gasoline and diesel will have an impact on fuel prices in Colombia, mining and energy minister German Arce told Reuters.\n\nAt least 2 million bpd of Gulf refining capacity is currently offline and damage assessments at four Corpus Christi, Texas, area oil refineries were underway on Saturday, a first step toward resuming production. However, by Sunday, more refineries were shuttered as the threat of flooding grew.\n\nAlternative supplies for some Latin American countries would have come from within the region several years ago, but the largest fuel producers such as Brazil and Venezuela now have very limited capacity for exports.\n\nJust over a decade ago, which was the last time a storm as powerful hit the U.S. mainland, the country was the biggest net importer of refined products in the world.\n\n\"It's a completely different world now than 2008 in terms of crude and products flows,\" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.

The all-cash deal, to be announced Monday, would give Gilead a foothold in a new type of personalized treatment that doctors say could save patients with the most dire cases of cancer and analysts estimate would ring up billions of dollars in sales.\n\nGilead, of Foster City, Calif., had been looking for an acquisition to diversify its portfolio beyond its leading position in infectious-disease treatments and provide a new revenue stream as sales of the company's hepatitis C drugs decline.\n\nThe deal for Kite would be one of Gilead's biggest, rivaling the company's $11 billion purchase of liver-disease drugmaker Pharmasset in 2012. Through that acquisition, Gilead gained hepatitis C therapies that are among the world's top-selling drugs.\n\nNow Gilead is betting that Kite can provide a similar payoff. Kite, of Santa Monica, Calif., is a leader among several companies that aim to use genetic engineering to weaponize a patient's own immune T cells and then deploy them to attack lymphoma and other blood cancers.\n\nKite's main drug, known as axi-cel, is up for approval in the U.S. and Europe. Analysts predict it would have world-wide sales of $1.7 billion in 2022, according to EvaluatePharma, which ranks the drug among the industry's top 10 compounds in terms of sales potential. Such expectations have already pushed the company's shares sharply higher this year.\n\nAxi-cel is likely to face swift, steep competition. Novartis AG, one of the leading cancer-drug makers, beat Kite to be the first company to ask the Food and Drug Administration to approve a bioengineered T-cell drug. Several other companies are developing the drugs too.\n\nGilead made its name selling treatments for HIV/AIDS. The biotech company surged in value after launching the hepatitis C treatments developed at Pharmasset. The drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, helped Gilead double its sales in 2014. It now has a market value of roughly $100 billion.\n\nLast year Gilead had $30 billion in sales, including $9.1 billion from Harvoni and $4 billion from Sovaldi.\n\nYet the anti-viral drugs' commercial success has also proved to be an albatross. Gilead faced public criticism and a Senate investigation for listing Sovaldi at $1,000 a day, even though the therapy cured most patients at a cost of less than a liver transplant.\n\nThe hepatitis C drugs' sales were squeezed in recent years when Merck & Co. launched a rival treatment, forcing Gilead to offer steep discounts to health plans. And partly because of the drugs' success curing the disease, fewer patients needed treatment.\n\nThe company's second-quarter hepatitis C drug sales fell to $2.9 billion world-wide, down from $4 billion during the period a year earlier.\n\nGilead has faced pressure from investors and analysts to find new revenue sources. Management responded by touting its next generation of HIV/AIDS treatments as well as drugs in development to treat a liver disease known as NASH, for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.\n\nBut Wall Street said Gilead needed to do another deal. Gilead fanned speculation by hiring Alessandro Riva from Novartis to run its hematology and oncology division, as well as its former adviser, investment banker Andrew Dickinson, from Lazard.\n\nAfter years of surging volume, pharmaceutical deal making has been slow this year, with very few megamergers aside from Johnson & Johnson's r oughly $30 billion deal to buy Actelion Ltd. Drug companies have been digesting earlier acquisitions and have also been hampered by uncertainty surrounding tax reform because many of them have large amounts of cash overseas.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, around the same time as the deadline for U.S. approval of Kite's main drug, according to the people familiar with the matter.\n\n--Dana Mattioli contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jonathan D.

With assets of 1.8 trillion yuan ($271 billion), the new entity will be the world\u2019s second-biggest company by revenue and largest by installed capacity, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\n\nThe Shenhua-Guodian tie-up may be the first of a handful of mergers in China\u2019s power industry as top policy makers try to cut industrial overcapacity and the number of state-owned enterprises. Monday\u2019s announcement concludes months of speculation about the combination, first reported by Bloomberg in June.\n\n\u201cPeople have been waiting for the other shoe to drop,\u201d said Tian Miao, a Beijing-based senior analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial Ltd. \u201cThis confirms the direction of state-owned enterprise reform, with companies in the same industry merging to reduce redundant investment and improve efficiency.\u201d\n\nFor a Gadfly column on the Shenhua-Guodian merger, click here.\n\nNeither Shenhua nor Guodian\u2019s Beijing-based spokesmen answered calls to their offices seeking comment or replied to emailed questions. About three hours before Sasac\u2019s one-sentence statement was released Monday, Ling Wen, Shenhua\u2019s acting chairman, told reporters in Hong Kong that the company still hadn\u2019t received merger approval.\n\nThe new company, expected to be called National Energy Investment Corp., will have installed capacity of more than 225 gigawatts, topping Electricite de France SA and Enel SpA, according to Frank Yu, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. EDF, as the French generator is known, had net installed capacity of 137.5 gigawatts last year, according to a company presentation. Italy\u2019s Enel had total installed capacity of 83 gigawatts as of June 30, it said.\n\nMutual Benefits\n\nShenhua will be able to lower its reliance on coal-fired capacity, currently about 90 percent, by gaining some of Guodian\u2019s clean energy assets, Yu wrote in a research note earlier this month. Guodian, meanwhile, will be able to benefit from Shenhua\u2019s coal supply and price risk management, as well as its integrated infrastructure of railways, harbors and ships.\n\nShares of Shenhua\u2019s Hong Kong-listed unit, China Shenhua Energy Co., rose as much as 4.7 percent to HK$20.10 on Monday, before paring its gain to close up 2.1 percent. The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended little changed.\n\nAs part of the merger, China Shenhua Energy may acquire Guodian\u2019s Shanghai-listed GD Power Development Co., Bloomberg news reported in late June. GD Power trading has been suspended since June 5, as have China Shenhua Energy\u2019s Shanghai shares.\n\nShenhua had 1.014 trillion yuan in assets, it said in a report in June, and its listed unit produced about 290 million tons of coal last year. Guodian had total assets of 803 billion yuan, according to a statement from the company posted by state-backed industry group China Electricity Council. Shenhua had 82 gigawatts of generating capacity, while Guodian had 145 gigawatts, according to BNEF.\n\nCoal & Renewables\n\nXi\u2019s government is also seeking to lower the country\u2019s reliance on coal power and increase the use natural gas, as well as wind, solar, hydropower and nuclear. The generation capacity of the merged company will be 23 percent renewables, according to BNEF.\n\n\u201cThis is crucial for Shenhua since due to new changes, wind, solar, nuclear and hydro generation hours are still guaranteed by regulators, while coal generators must increasingly compete in liberalized wholesale markets,\u201d BNEF analyst Sophie Lu wrote in an Aug. 9 report. \u201cThis is only one in a series of mega-mergers China plans for power sector consolidation.\u201d\n\nThe government may also seek a way to bundle nuclear power generators into the mega-merger mix, according to Wood Mackenzie\u2019s Yu.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is to form bigger energy companies that can hedge against market risks between coal and power,\u201d Yu said. \u201cOr they can sell their nuclear technology or their coal-power technology to emerging markets in Asia. That\u2019s what the government wants to promote.\u201d\n\nChina Huaneng Group, the country\u2019s biggest coal-fired power producer, may merge with State Power Investment Corp., a coal-fired generator that also owns State Nuclear Power Technology Corp., Bloomberg reported in May. SPIC Chairman Wang Binghua said in July that the company is in contact with Huaneng Group about a restructuring and \u201csomething big may happen later.\u201d\n\nChina Huadian Corp. and China Datang Corp. are the remaining two of China\u2019s big-five state-power generators.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Aibing Guo, Jing Yang, Francois De Beaupuy, and Chiara Albanese", "source_url": "https://www.bloomberg.com", "date": "2017-08-28", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "images": ["https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipi2ZUDf0ao8/v0/1200x809.jpg", "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQLmbjoLOE98/v1/60x-1.png"]}, {"title": "Amazon/Whole Foods Effect On Grocery Spending", "text": "Fanny Fern was the highest paid journalist in the country in 1855 because of her \u201cwitty and irreverent\u201d tell-it-like-it-is style.

How things play out could give Fanny Fern\u2019s adage a decidedly modern and competitive twist: The way to Amazon\u2019s food commerce heart is through the stomachs of its Prime members.\n\nOf Food and Stomachs\n\nWhen the news broke last week that Whole Foods would lower prices for some items, starting today, in their stores, it sent grocery stocks reeling. They lost $12 billion dollars that day.\n\nFocusing on how the Great American Kale Sale could make kale great again (btw, kale is sooo 2016 \u2014 Whole Foods didn\u2019t even have it as a top food pick for 2017) and how it could put pressure on grocery stores to lower their own prices is like talking about whether it was a good idea to rearrange the deck chairs to make the Titanic look nice on the way down.\n\nIt\u2019s the wrong thing on which to focus.\n\nWhat is, though, is how Amazon will materially gut the three things that grocery stores thought would keep them competitive: their private label brands, their shelves of organic foods and their loyalty programs.\n\nOf course, lowering prices is a tactic, but one that\u2019s less about signaling that Amazon wants to make Whole Foods wholly more affordable and more about getting consumer feet inside those stores, buying the cheap kale, bananas and organic eggs \u2014 and then lots more stuff once they get there. Remember, Whole Food\u2019s year-over-year same-store comparisons had been off for seven quarters before Amazon decided to buy them. Those lackluster figures were one of the reasons that Whole Foods\u2019 investors started getting grumpy about two years ago. Getting feet in the stores and grocery spending is pretty important.\n\nBut it\u2019s also about giving consumers a taste of the Amazon experience when it comes to full-service grocery, including the purchase of prepared foods, yoga mats, natural personal products and flowers in the physical grocery store. And the trusted and recognizable yellow Amazon logo and messaging that they\u2019ll likely see when they walk through the doors.\n\nIt\u2019s about signaling that Amazon Prime customers will soon get lots of benefits when they use their Prime accounts \u2014 a.k.a. Amazon Pay \u2014 to check out (or to check-in?) at Whole Foods. And how that enormous \u2014 and enormously Prime loyal consumer base \u2014 will shake up how, when and where all organic food \u2014 not just groceries \u2014 is purchased, paid for and eaten.\n\nBut mostly it\u2019s about how everyone from payments players to logistics and delivery providers, grocery stores and CPGs (consumer packaged goods), local restaurants and QSRs (quick service restaurants) and independent local food markets will soon feel the ripple effects of Amazon\u2019s grocery flywheel.\n\nFrom my perch anyway, Whole Foods is a lot more than just Amazon\u2019s grocery play \u2014 it\u2019s Amazon\u2019s flywheel into local retail, restaurant and services.\n\nWhich makes it time for every one of you guys reading this to huddle in your war rooms to figure out your next moves.\n\nThe Platform to End All Platforms\n\nFor a company that didn\u2019t start life as a platform, Amazon has sure mastered the art of platform ignition.\n\nAnd no, Amazon wasn\u2019t always a platform.\n\nWhat started out in 1995 as a place online to buy books that they bought and resold (not a platform) has become the world\u2019s most powerful eCommerce platform twenty-two years later. Amazon\u2019s done that by creating a marketplace that attracts sellers by giving them access to lots of buyer eyeballs and services like Fulfillment by Amazon, working capital and the ability to add the Amazon Pay button to their website. More sellers pull in more buyers who buy lots of stuff at better prices that they can get in two days \u2014 and sometimes even faster than that. Amazon\u2019s Marketplace now accounts for 50 percent of units sold and (at last count) 80 million consumers fork over $99 a year to be a Prime member in exchange for two-day free shipping and access to lots of other things, including video and music streaming.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before and so many times, all of these things together \u2014 plus all of the things that they\u2019ve added over the years \u2014 have recast the consumer\u2019s expectations of all retailers: low prices, expedited delivery and an always-changing supply of products from which to choose. In Amazon\u2019s case, that\u2019s now more than four hundred million SKUs (stock keeping units).\n\nThe so-called \u201cAmazon Effect\u201d that everyone talks about isn\u2019t because of the share shift that Amazon is driving \u2014 since Amazon, overall, accounts for less than 5 percent of all retail, excluding auto \u2014 but because retailers that don\u2019t deliver to Amazon\u2019s standard don\u2019t get their business, or as much of it, anymore.\n\nWhen it comes to the \u201cAmazon Effect\u201d and groceries, those of you who follow me regularly also got a sneak peek into my thinking about their grocery game plan in April 2015 after Amazon launched Dash buttons and I wrote a piece asking whether Amazon would do to grocery stores what it did to bookstores (I said yes by changing how consumers buy groceries and use grocery stores). And then again, a few months ago when I commented specifically on the implications of Amazon\u2019s bid to buy Whole Foods (to change how consumers buy all their food, not just the groceries that they take home and use to prepare meals).\n\nNow that we have a peek into what Amazon has said they plan to do with Whole Foods, it seems that it is now all of that \u2014 and then some.\n\nBlurred Lines in Aisle 17\n\nAccording to the USDA, U.S. consumers today spend nearly 10 percent of their income on food \u2014 5.3 percent on groceries that they buy and bring home to cook and then eat and another 4.3 percent on food that they eat out. Those lines have gotten increasingly blurry over the years as busy families and not-all-that-interested-in-cooking millennials ratchet up their grocery spend on ready-to-eat/convenience foods.\n\nAmazon, with the Whole Foods acquisition, will make those lines blurrier, still.\n\nThe USDA reports that 26 percent of a consumer\u2019s food budget is now allocated to those ready-to-eat/convenience foods \u2014 a.k.a. fast food bought at QSRs. In an attempt to siphon some of that spend back to them, grocery stores have beefed up their selection of prepared foods. According to NPD Group, in 2015, 40 percent of consumers bought prepared foods there. They also report that sales of prepared foods at grocery stores have increased 30 percent since 2008, accounting for 2.4 billion trips to the grocery store in 2015.\n\nToday, Whole Foods devotes a fair amount of real estate to prepared foods and will likely sharpen its focus there going forward. It won\u2019t just be other grocery stores that will potentially feel the prepared foods competition \u2014 QSRs will too, as consumers opt for a \u201chealthier\u201d set of options at Whole Foods, quite possibly delivered to their homes by Amazon trucks for free as part of a Prime membership.\n\nMeal kits will feel the slow burn, too \u2014 see Blue Apron as Exhibit A. Meal kits sound great until they arrive and the consumer realizes that the \u201ckit\u201d part of it means that they still have to cook, wash the pots and pans and be content with portioned meals with no leftovers.\n\nAmazon Fresh will likely play a starring role in making that shift \u2014 and the blurring of the lines \u2014 more pronounced now that Whole Foods is officially in the tent. It will be interesting to watch what, if anything, happens with the annual fee, the roster of participating players and the pricing of foods offered.\n\nAnd, how prepared foods from Whole Foods will be priced to make them more appetizing to consumers.\n\nThe Price Is Always Right\n\nSpeaking of pricing, Amazon has already proven that it\u2019s mastered the pricing game on both national and private label brands.\n\nAmazon\u2019s pricing algorithms are legendary, although no one outside Amazon really knows how they work. What\u2019s certain is that Amazon constantly monitors the prices of goods sold by competitors and what products are selling. They then take action on seeing that data. So, it\u2019s not uncommon for Amazon to drop the prices of items that are selling well to less than what competitors sell it for or raise prices on the things that aren\u2019t \u2014 sort of a reverse supply and demand to get consumers hooked. Most consumers either don\u2019t notice or don\u2019t care on an item-by-item basis, and, if they do, they\u2019re happy to trade off a couple of bucks for the certainty of delivery in two days, for free.\n\nNow, with Whole Foods, Amazon has roughly 40,000 new physical grocery SKUs to monitor and play with, accordingly \u2014 and use to sharpen its pricing of grocery products sold on Amazon today through Pantry, its Dash buttons and offline in their physical stores.\n\nWhen Private Labels Become Very Public\n\nPrivate label brands were once viewed by most consumers as the brands for people who couldn\u2019t afford to pay for \u201cname brands.\u201d No more. Today, 80 percent of consumers say they see no perceptible difference in product quality between the two.\n\nNot surprisingly, private label strategies rank at the top of the grocery store survival list.\n\nThe intersection of consumer preference and the chance to offer consumers cheaper products without taking a hit on margins has caused grocery stores to expand those parts of their businesses. Nielsen says that roughly 21 percent of traditional grocery store SKUs are private label brands, increasingly driving more consumer spend. The Private Label Manufacturers Association (PLMA) claims that more than 50 percent of consumers bought more store brands from grocery stores in 2016 than they did a year ago \u2014 saving about a third of their spend on basic grocery and household items.\n\nAmazon got into the private label game in 2009 and since then has introduced more than 20 private label brands. In each case and category, those private label products have quickly gained share on national brands. For example, 1010data reports that 94 percent of all batteries sold online are sold via Amazon. After only a few years, Amazon\u2019s private label battery brand now accounts for a third of all online battery sales.\n\nA little more than two years after Amazon introduced private label baby wipes, 1010data also reports that Amazon holds a 16 percent share of the market, just behind Huggies (33 percent) and Pampers (26 percent), and has grown 266 percent year over year.\n\nPrivate label is also a big deal for Whole Foods. In 2014, Whole Foods\u2019 private label 365 brand accounted for roughly 13 percent of its sales. Amazon said last Thursday that it will begin selling the Whole Foods 365 line online. There, no doubt, we\u2019ll see Amazon\u2019s powerful pricing engine rev up to compete with both national brands and grocery store private label brands.\n\nAnalysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey project that over the next five years, the sale of Amazon\u2019s private label brands could reach as much as $20 billion \u2014 and that was before the Whole Foods buy.\n\nTaking a Swipe at Loyalty\n\nGrocery stores have long used loyalty programs as a lure to get consumers to shop more frequently at their stores. Nearly 80 percent of grocery stores have a loyalty program in place. But having a loyalty program hasn\u2019t necessarily kept consumers loyal. Only 18 percent of consumers say that they\u2019re totally loyal to a single grocery store, with the vast majority of people reporting that they more or less play the field.\n\nThis has been confirmed by the fact that half of all U.S. shoppers travel to three or more stores to get their grocery and household items.\n\nOne loyalty program that has kept consumers loyal is Amazon Prime. Amazon Prime members shop more frequently (raise your hands if you\u2019ve ever bought more than once a day on Amazon and thought nothing of it) and spend more than twice ($1300) each year than what non-Prime members spend ($700). It\u2019s been reported by retail consultancy, Magid, that roughly two-thirds of Amazon Prime members are also Whole Foods customers. Analysts have suggested that\u2019s a bad thing, since it\u2019s not necessarily a big net add for Amazon Prime.\n\nI think that\u2019s a glass very much half empty way to look at it.\n\nAmazon has hinted that Amazon Prime members will get special goodies in the form of savings and other services at Whole Foods \u201cdown the road.\u201d These are the same consumers who are loyal to the brand, shop at Amazon and currently shop at three grocery stores, on average.\n\nIf just half of those consumers sifted just a third of their grocery spending to the combination of Amazon and Whole Foods, well, you do the math.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of a platform.\n\nLearning from Books(stores)\n\nWhen Amazon started life as a bookseller, it was about selling things online that consumers didn\u2019t need to inspect to buy. A book on a shelf at Borders or Waldenbooks or B. Dalton or Barnes & Noble all looked and read the same way as that same book did at Amazon.\n\nOnly cheaper.\n\nThe more successful Amazon became at selling books cheaper online and getting them delivered fast, the less able physical bookstores could compete. Since 1994, almost all of the major bookstores have closed \u2014 names of shops you probably know and often frequented: Atlantic Books, B. Dalton, Borders, Crown Books, Lauriat\u2019s, Hastings Entertainment, Kroch\u2019s and Brentano\u2019s and Mr. Paperback. Borders even tried the \u201cif you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u201d strategy in 2008 and used Amazon to sell their books online.\n\nThey went belly up in 2011.\n\nBarnes & Noble, the last man sort of standing, has shriveled to a mere semblance of itself, with a stock trading at $7 and change, off from a high of $28 in July of 2015. It operates 633 stores now, down from 726 in 2011, with reported plans to close more than 197 stores over the next three years. Independent booksellers have taken a hit, too. By the end of 2009, the American Booksellers Association reported that only about 1,651 of the more than 4,000 independent bookstores that existed in the early 1990s still had their doors open.\n\nIn 2012, in a bold move to meet Amazon on its home technology plus bookseller turf, Barnes & Noble CEO, William Lynch, told The New York Times that it had become a \u201ctechnology company\u201d \u2014 flashing the chain\u2019s newly minted eReader, the Nook, as proof. Unfortunately for Lynch and his franchise, it was too little technology about a year too late. Euromonitor reported that 2012 was the first year of the great eReader sales decline. Sales of eReaders dropped by more than 40 percent between 2011 and 2016.\n\nBut that really didn\u2019t matter a lick to Amazon, who\u2019d long since turned the Kindle device into an app that anyone could download to their existing tablet or smart device in 2010. And it\u2019s a pretty good thing they did. Despite our digital proclivities, it seems that consumers still prefer their physical books \u2014 Pew reported in April of 2017 that only 28 percent of consumers read an eBook, compared to 65 percent who read the real deal.\n\nOver that same period of time, independents tried to fight back too \u2014 and for a while it seemed like all was lost for them, too. But a funny thing happened on the way to buying books: The independent bookstores began to emerge, recast as smaller format stores catering to the needs and tastes of the local community, educators and families. In July of 2017, The American Booksellers Association said that the number of independent bookstores had swelled by more than 700 to 2,320 across the U.S., with more waiting in the wings.\n\nBut, there\u2019s a \u201cbut.\u201d\n\nThese smaller footprint stores do offer more than just a place to buy a book. Sometimes they double as office space in the back with a retail space in the front to sell books for a business owner who loves books and wants to subsidize the office rent. Other times, they\u2019re a part-time job for a book lover intent on creating a destination using books and coffee and food and events to appeal to the local community.\n\nBut neither, as its owners contend, means that they will succeed as measured by dollars and cents.\n\n\u201cIf joy is the only metric of success, and I think it is, it has been successful \u2014 and I am enjoying the ride,\u201d remarked one such bookstore owner.\n\nWhich is not exactly a ringing endorsement for the profit-making potential of these independent bookstores.\n\nTheir survival will depend on the local communities\u2019 interest in changing the way they buy books today \u2014 from a shop close to where they live and where they can buy a book and walk home with it that very day \u2014 but from a more limited, curated collection at a higher price.\n\nThe End and the Beginning\n\nThe acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon was an important step in moving Amazon into a world where consumers like to see and inspect the goods they buy before they buy them. It\u2019s one thing to buy a book online or a box of Tide laundry detergent online, since a Tide is a Tide is a Tide.\n\nBut it\u2019s another when picking out steaks for the grill or tomatoes and lettuce for a salad.\n\nOr, yes, even kale.\n\nAmazon could never get there online even though food, like books, is something everyone buys. The Whole Foods acquisition was a right place/right time opportunity for them.\n\nBut as Whole Foods is looking to shed its \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d reputation, Amazon plus Whole Foods is looking to capture the consumer\u2019s whole spending on food. \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d aside, Whole Foods has also earned the reputation for being a pretty hip and happening place to shop for food. They\u2019ve ditched the standard grocery store Musak for lively tunes, and the people who work there are friendly and helpful. Some Whole Foods have even created spaces where people can buy prepared foods and eat \u2014 and in those stores, it\u2019s also become a place to meet friends and hang out and eat.\n\nAmazon is the master at knowing how to leverage its assets \u2014 its data on prices and what consumers are buying, its Prime members who are always getting new reasons to stay Prime \u2014 to shape consumer preferences and their expectations of retailers.\n\nThe combination of a hip and happening grocery store with a data and technology-savvy retailer is a recipe for not only disrupting grocery sales, but changing how local retail looks \u2014 and even how competitors view and use their services.\n\nWhole Foods with Amazon could become logistical hubs for local grocery stores, just like Fulfillment by Amazon is a fulfillment option for a number of physical retailers. Existing delivery services like Door Dash and Instacart could find themselves displaced by Amazon\u2019s delivery operations. Whole Foods\u2019 physical stores could, themselves, become marketplaces for local food purveyors as they set the bar for what charting a \u201cgrocerant\u201d looks and feels like. Whole Foods could even become the next generation of \u201csupercenter\u201d by hosting complementary retail storefronts inside its stores for those who\u2019d rather trade a huge showroom for the chance to be in front of its loyal and high-spending Prime customer base.\n\nIncluding Amazon\u2019s own bookstores.\n\nAll linked to an Amazon account that makes buying easy and payment so frictionless that consumers don\u2019t even think about it anymore.\n\nFor Amazon and Whole Foods, this is just the beginning of their journey to change how consumers buy food.\n\nFor grocery stores, it\u2019s just the beginning, too.\n\nAnd if the past is prologue, there will be margin-crushing price wars followed by waves of store consolidation followed by a winnowing of brands that are too small to survive or too stuck in the middle to compete. We\u2019ll see grocery brands invest in technology in an effort to get to parity. But by then, Amazon will have likely moved on to the next frontier \u2014 using AR and VR to shop at the store via their phones or just having Alexa on speed dial to do all the heavy lifting.\n\nWith the Whole Foods acquisition, more than opening upon a handful of bookstores, Amazon has taken the retail wars into the physical world using Whole Foods as its physical retail flywheel. Be happy if you don\u2019t own a supermarket chain. Be worried if you own any other large retail business \u2014 or sell branded consumer products.\n\nEspecially if you do it on the local level. There may be riches in the local retail niches, but it just may take some digging out of a few deep retail ditches to find them.", "source_url": "http://www.pymnts.com", "date": "2017-08-28", "fake or

wants Expedia Dara Khosrowshahi to be its next CEO. But here is a shocking twist for those who have had to endure this awful, messy and convoluted process: He has not been officially offered the job as of 15 minutes ago, said sources.\n\nStill, most expect him to take it and he appears to be the one person dueling factions of the board can agree on. Unknown until now, Khosrowshahi was the third candidate \u2014 after Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman and former General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt.\n\nKhosrowshahi is considered the \u201ctruce\u201d choice for the board, which has been riven by ugly infighting between ousted CEO Travis Kalanick and one of its major investors, Benchmark. Benchmark had backed Whitman, while Kalanick had backed Immelt.\n\nSources said that going into this morning, after Immelt withdrew his name from contention when it was clear he would not win the job, Whitman had the upper hand in the race for the job.

Similar ones circulated in mid-August when chairman Wang went to Lanzhou.\u201d\n\nThe latest stories, which first emerged on a financial blog, asserted that Wang was detained by authorities when he and his family were en route to the airport in Tianjin, near Beijing, for a planned flight to Britain. The reports said Wang was prevented from leaving China and released after a few hours.\n\nWanda sent Variety a written statement denying the rumor. But a spokesman declined to add to the statement, and did not say whether Wang is currently in China or not. The statement threatens legal action against media engaged in spreading fabrications about the company.\n\nDalian Wanda, Wang\u2019s property-to-entertainment behemoth, is not listed. But the Hong Kong-traded shares of its hospitality group, Wanda Hotel Developments, were down 8% at HK$1.59, by the stock market close at 4:30 p.m. Monday, local time. The hotel subsidiary is the only Wanda company actively trading at the moment, as Wanda Film Holdings shares have been suspended since July and Wanda Commercial Properties shares were de-listed earlier this year on Hong Kong and have not yet been re-listed in mainland China.\n\nDespite Monday\u2019s fall Wanda Hotel shares remain up by 72% on the month, having soared from HK$0.92 on Aug. 1. Investors looked favorably on the unit\u2019s acquisition of a hotel management business that it bought from Wang, in yet another piece of Wanda group restructuring.\n\nIn the feverish atmosphere currently surrounding Wanda and a handful of other high-profile Chinese companies involved in overseas acquisitions, which have found themselves slapped down by the government, it is difficult to tell fact from fiction amid a welter of rumors.\n\nIn July, Wanda denied reports that state-owned investment firms had been ordered to sell its stock and corporate debt. A few days later, however, a note emerged online from a meeting between regulators and bankers showing that state-owned banks had halted lending to Wanda and its subsidiaries.\n\nAnother rumor currently making the rounds says that the heads of all major listed companies and state-owned enterprises have been effectively grounded and required to remain in China until after the upcoming Communist Party Congress.

A birds-eye view of the damage shows the full impact of the storm. USA TODAY\n\nSam Speights holds two of his dogs as he checks on the damage to his home in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Sunday, Aug. 27, 2017, in Rockport, Texas. Speights tried to stay in his home during the storm but had to move to other shelter after his lost his roof and back wall. (Photo: Eric Gay, AP)\n\nHurricane Harvey is expected to cause $5 billion to $10 billion in property damage in Texas, and that means tens of thousands of insurance claims.\n\nUnfortunately, standard homeowners\u2019 and renters\u2019 insurance policies may cover wind damage but not groundwater flooding. That requires separate coverage from the National Flood Insurance Program or a private insurance company.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also offers grants to victims but \"this amount is often much less than what is needed to recover,\" FEMA says.\n\nHere are some tips for Texas residents affected by the storm:\n\n\u2022 Contact your insurance company as soon as possible to report the claim. Insurers typically visit the most severely damaged areas first, so be prepared to provide an accurate description of any damages, says the Insurance Information Institute (III). Make sure to get a claim number and write it down since it\u2019s the quickest and easiest way for insurance companies to locate your file, according to the Consumer Federation of America (CFA).\n\nAsk the company when you can expect to be contacted by an insurance adjuster. It could be anywhere from a week to five to six months, depending on the extent of the claim, according to HouseLogic, a website operated by the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\u2022 Document your losses with pictures and video, if possible, and include a list of damaged personal items, says John Salter, certified financial planner at Evensky & Katz in Lubbock, Texas. Include the date of purchase and approximate value of any damaged items and collect receipts, III says.\n\n\u2022 Keep good records of anything you spend to make immediate repairs to secure your home, as well as receipts for hotels and meals if you can\u2019t return home right away, CFA says.\n\n\u2022 Check with your insurance company before discarding damaged items. You typically need to show them to your adjuster, according to III. but if your municipality requires you to discard them for safety reasons, take photographs to help with claims.\n\n\u2022 Keep a claim diary. Start a notebook with contact information of the people you deal with from your insurance company. Make a list of everyone you speak to and note the date, time and issues discussed, CFA says.\n\n\u2022 Sign up for text alerts. Many insurance companies use SMS/text alerts to notify you of the status of your claim, III says. You\u2019ll get messages when you first report your claim, when your estimate is available and when a payment has been sent.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2xFtZmd", "source_url": "https://www.usatoday.com", "date": "2017-08-28", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Published A M Et Aug", "Paul Davidson"], "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9f2c77c49ee5c8c5597ec74afecf329ec1d3fc20/r=540/https/media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5553944618001_5553943720001-vs.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-3304.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/de47b84ffea438e80e4297309e5dd269e370d4c5/c=194-0-4402-3164&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/08/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636394501094540688-AP-Harvey.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-nav-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16bf15e5a24a42033515b7502c1af02460bc3124/c=0-77-5328-3087&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/08/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636394501094540688-AP-Harvey.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-masthead-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-3304.0/images/indicators/facebook-loading.gif"]}, {"title": "CBS CORPORATION TO ACQUIRE NETWORK TEN IN AUSTRALIA", "text": "Deal to Buy Network Ten Will Accelerate CBS\u2019 Global Growth Strategy in Key English-speaking Market\n\nAcquisition Also Paves the Way to Launch\n\nCBS All Access in Australia\n\nSYDNEY, AMSTERDAM AND NEW YORK \u2013 August 27, 2017 \u2013 CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS.A and CBS) has agreed to acquire Network Ten, one of three major commercial broadcast networks in Australia, it was announced today by Chairman and CEO Leslie Moonves.

(SPG) Technical Resistance and Key Price Levels to Watch", "text": "With all other things going on, Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) has been on a run \u2014 rising 1.13 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider Simon Property Group, Inc. a buy, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG)\u2018s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment\u2019s value to increase over time. So is with Simon Property Group, Inc.. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $31.46 below SPG\u2019s recent stock price. That\u2019s the optimistic view from Wall Street.\n\nThe stock has actually made sharp losses in the past year, as the company has gathered a -26.22% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price is down -37.96% from previous highs of around $219.41 per share on September 02, 2016. On the bright side, the company\u2019s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 26.87% since hitting lows of $150.15 on June 05, 2017.\n\nFinally, from a technical perspective, there\u2019s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $154.15 and $156.6. In terms of pullbacks, $160.74 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.\n\nSimon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session Simon Property Group, Inc. RSI was seen at 49.15. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock\u2019s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.\n\nWith these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG) has been put into a buy territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for SPG is 36.06. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses.\n\n14-day Williams %R for Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) moved to around 54.87. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought.", "source_url": "http://www.usacommercedaily.com", "date": "2017-08-28", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Isabel Sutton"], "images": ["http://www.usacommercedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/st20-100x70.jpg", "http://www.usacommercedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/st23-100x70.jpg", "http://www.usacommercedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/st7.jpg", "http://www.usacommercedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/st19-100x70.png", "http://www.usacommercedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/logo.png", "http://www.usacommercedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/st21-100x70.jpg"]}, {"title": "Mesa Royalty Trust (NYSE:MTR) Traded Above Its 50 Day Average", "text": "By\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is currently trading at $13.40 which is marginally higher than $12.25, the 50 day moving average and which is marginally over the 200 day moving average of $12.83.

A-Rod! J.Lo! LeBron! \u2014 had long since filtered out of T-Mobile Arena to board their private jets and discuss Floyd Mayweather Jr.\u2019s 10-round technical knockout of Conor McGregor.\n\nBut the two celebrities who made the biggest Vegas haul Saturday night \u2014 Mayweather and McGregor \u2014 remained behind for a post-fight press conference, with a podium set up on the very stage where, less than an hour earlier, they were trying to beat each other\u2019s brains out.\n\nOnly now it was if they were two old men sitting on a front porch somewhere and talking about personal soap operas that had played out so long ago that neither of them seemed to remember what the big fuss was all about in the first place.\n\nAllow me to refresh their memories: Throughout the run-up to this fight, so much trash was flying back and forth that it was as though the nation\u2019s sanitation workers had gone on strike. McGregor, a white man from Dublin, Ireland, talked the most trash. And his trash was particularly gamey, as he frequently referred to Mayweather, a black man, as \u201cboy\u201d during his various rants, proclamations and promises.\n\nInteresting that McGregor stayed away from the real stuff: Mayweather has been convicted of battery against women. Twice.\n\nIf McGregor was as unhinged as he wanted us to think he was, might not he have gone there?\n\nInstead, and as recently as Friday, during a glitzy weigh-in production that was as much a floor show as anything being offered on the Strip, he suggested that Mayweather was lazy, that he may have a gambling problem.\n\nThere was, then, a racial underbelly to this fight.\n\nSometimes it was flat-out uncomfortable: It\u2019s the 21st century, and no white man can refer to a black man as \u201cboy\u201d and not make everyone want to open a window.\n\nSometimes it was in the background. As was pointed out to me by Los Angeles Times columnist Dylan Hernandez, the official poster for this fight showed Mayweather\u2019s face over a black background, McGregor\u2019s over a white background. And this image was everywhere, including the swipe key to my room at the MGM Grand.\n\nIs this really necessary? Do we need to have a heapin\u2019 helpin\u2019 of Great White Hope stew placed in front of us as a pre-fight appetizer, complete with McGregor advancing the plot by going with the boy bit?\n\nIt was all so clever \u2014 not so odious as to inspire protest marches, but with enough of a whiff that you couldn\u2019t not notice it.\n\nThe post-fight press conference was a wonderfully pleasant affair, proving either that a) McGregor was merely reading from a script during the weeks and days leading up to the showdown, or b) the two men really do hate each other but were able to summon very good acting skills for the post-fight presser.\n\nMayweather spoke first, going on and on about the fight, about his strategy, his retirement, his father, etc. It was while he was talking about the advantages of the old iPod over the new iPod \u2014 seriously, that\u2019s what he was saying \u2014 that he spied a dressed-to-the-nines McGregor emerging from a tunnel.\n\n\u201cCome on up here, Conor!\u201d said Mayweather.\n\nSuddenly they were two old army buddies. They were former roommates reunited at a college reunion. They were a long-retired double-play combination brought back for old-timers day. Alan Trammell. Lou Whitaker.\n\nAs it happened, this fight, though laughably contrived, didn\u2019t need an Archie Bunker-esque subplot to be memorable. We\u2019ll remember the fight because, surprise, surprise, it was pretty good. No, it wasn\u2019t great boxing, and the guy we thought would win the fight won the fight. And while it soon became obvious that Mayweather had a very simple game plan \u2014 let McGregor win the first three rounds and then move in for the kill as the Irishman began to wear down \u2014 there was at least a shred of doubt over the outcome as late as the opening bell to the fifth round. (Just a shred, mind you.)\n\nI\u2019m no boxing guy, which in a weird way makes me just as qualified as anyone to write about what happened in the ring Saturday night, since this wasn\u2019t real boxing. It was a retired ex-champion getting himself back in shape in order to fight a mixed martial arts champion who never before had competed in a professional boxing match. There was, then, a goofy leveling of the playing field: Retired guy vs. novice. A spectacle is what it was, and I know how to write about spectacles: I covered the famous speakerphone press conference at Weeb Ewbank Hall back in \u201997 when Bill Belichick was named fake head coach of the Jets, with Bill Parcells signing on as a fake \u201cconsultant.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m OK with spectacles and I enjoyed this one. If you were in attendance or made a pay-per-view investment, I suspect you enjoyed it as well.\n\nThe fight itself was the contrivance. As for dropping a dab of racial strife into the mix, that would have been a cheap stunt had it been done a year ago, five years ago, 10 years ago.\n\nThat it was done in the year 2017, with all that\u2019s happening around us, is unconscionable.", "source_url": "http://www.bostonherald.com", "date": "None", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Jason Mastrodonato", "Michael Silverman", "Karen Guregian", "Steve Buckley"], "images": ["http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/featured_medium/public/media/2017/08/27/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-entrances-twitter-reaction.jpg?itok=Wo3liAip&c=3fec780cfa923157551d374478833e21", "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/media/2017/08/27/082717mcgregor.jpg?itok=a_l6EPXA", "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/featured_medium/public/media/2016/06/11/081817hitman1.jpg?itok=SrzgzleW&c=e43081b8000773f51cdd29805d857df2", "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/partlycloudy_826.gif?itok=xbCvV5Bd", "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/featured_medium/public/media/ap/2017/08/27/c4a5148c05034c4fbc6d881a45fa993c.jpg?itok=rgzEvMUW&c=982d56977211b48ee2ba4ebb9b3ac02d", "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/all/modules/custom/bh_radio/theme/images/radio-bhr-logo.png", "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/gallery/public/media/2017/08/27/082717mcgregor.jpg?itok=Y-p3PqTa"]}, {"title": "Eric Reid decides to kneel during anthem again: We\u2019re not \u201cun-American.\u201d \u2013 ProFootballTalk", "text": "Getty Images\n\nEric Reid protested during the national anthem all last year, kneeling with then teammate-Colin Kaepernick, but decided this offseason it was time to move on.\n\nWith time to reflect on what happened two weeks ago in Charlottesville, he decided he needed to continue.\n\nReid was again on one knee during last night\u2019s game against the Vikings, and explained to reporters afterward why he had the \u201cchange of heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of thinking. A lot of praying. Talking to Colin.\u201d he said, via Matt Maiocco of NBC Sports Bay Area. \u201cWhen we started last year, if you recall, we said our goal was to raise awareness and shed light on the issues that were happening in our country. I think we accomplished that goal. What I was upset about was the narrative, the false narrative, that were being told about us, people saying that we\u2019re un-American, that we\u2019re against police entirely and the military. That just wasn\u2019t true. At first I thought that was a small sacrifice to pay to get the word out and raise awareness. I settled with thinking raising that awareness was victory.\n\n\u201cThen fast forward to Charlottesville and the country sees what an un- American protest really looks like. That\u2019s when I had my change of heart. Because what Colin, Eli and I did was a peaceful protest fueled by faith in God to help make our country a better place. I feel I needed to regain control of that narrative and not let people say that what we\u2019re doing is un-American, because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s completely American. We\u2019re doing it because we want equality for everybody. We want our country to be a better place. So that\u2019s why I decided to resume the protest.\u201d\n\nReid said he planned to continue with the protest throughout the year. Teammates were gathered around him last night, and he said he appreciated the support. And as he enters a free agent year and has seen what happened to Kaepernick, he said he\u2019s aware of what could happen to him and is not worried about future economic fallout.\n\n\u201cThis has been fueled by my faith in God,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason I do it. You can\u2019t serve God and money.

(1:13)\n\nAfter Cleveland's physical examination of Isaiah Thomas' injured hip raised concern about the timeline for his return this season, Cavaliers officials are planning to seek an additional trade asset before finalizing a deal to send four-time All-Star guard Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, league sources said.\n\nWithout revisions to the original trade agreement, the Cavaliers could threaten to veto the trade, league sources said.\n\nThe Cavaliers' stance could trigger a standoff between Cleveland and Boston officials, forcing both organizations to weigh the consequences of letting the blockbuster trade implode.\n\nEditor's Picks Stevens: 'Incredible' what Thomas did in Boston When asked by a young fan why he traded away Isaiah Thomas earlier this week, Celtics coach Brad Stevens responded \"That's an excellent question,\" after laughter dissipated.\n\nHow Danny Ainge raised the roof on Celtics' expectations A team of scrappy overachievers was not enough for Boston's hoops architect, who yearned for a roster with a higher ceiling and a better chance of turning the Celtics into a title contender.\n\nAre the Celtics a better team after Irving trade? The Celtics have only four players left from last season's team that reached the Eastern Conference finals. It is difficult to judge whether they are a better team after trading for Kyrie Irving. 2 Related\n\nThe proposed trade sending Irving to the Celtics for two-time All-Star Thomas, forward Jae Crowder, center Ante Zizic and an unprotected 2018 first-round pick via Brooklyn was thrust into uncertainty once Thomas underwent his exam in Cleveland on Friday, league sources said. The deadline to report and submit to a physical for the players involved in the trade is 10 a.m. ET Wednesday, and the deadline to pass the physical is 10 a.m. ET Thursday, per league rules.\n\nHowever, if both teams mutually agree to extend the deadline, they can. Once the sides re-engage, Cavaliers officials may try to make the case that Boston undersold them on the scope of the Thomas injury, and more specifically, how soon Thomas could be prepared to play this season, league sources said. The sides did discuss and share information on Thomas' injury, sources said.\n\nBecause Thomas is in the final year of his contract -- which coincides with LeBron James' opt-out next summer -- Cleveland has an urgency to get Thomas on the court this year.\n\nAll along, Boston has believed it was clear in its assessment of Thomas' physical status and that the information was communicated to the Cavaliers in the conversations before Tuesday's trade, league sources said. In a telephone conference call with reporters after the trade was announced, Celtics general manager Danny Ainge admitted that Thomas' physical condition played \"some\" role in trading him to Cleveland as part of the Irving package.\n\nNotable Celtics Trade Assets The Celtics will have six first-round picks the next two drafts (barring protections), giving them plenty of draft capital to put in a Kyrie Irving trade. 2018 Lakers pick (ONLY if 2-5) 2018 Own pick 2019 Kings/76ers pick* (top-1 protected) 2019 Clippers pick (top-14 protected) 2019 Grizzlies pick (top-8 protected) 2019 Own pick * Only if Lakers pick does not convey\n\nCleveland had significantly valued the 2018 Nets pick in the trade, and Boston believed it allowed for Thomas' physical uncertainty in the current terms of the deal, league sources said.\n\nThomas, 28, will be an unrestricted free agent in 2018, and could still re-establish his market value with a strong performance and a return to his quick, explosive self. Cleveland had coveted 2017 No. 3 overall draft pick Jayson Tatum, but Boston has consistently remained unwilling to include him into trade talks for Irving, league sources said.\n\nBesides its own future first-round picks, Boston has possible access to future protected picks from the Los Angeles Lakers (2018), LA Clippers (2019) and Memphis Grizzlies (2019). Boston has control of several second-round draft picks, too, which also could be included into a deal.\n\nIrving was scheduled to take his physical with the Celtics on Saturday in Boston, league sources said. He had requested a trade from Cleveland earlier in the summer, and the possibility of finding another significant deal package without Boston's assets as leverage in the negotiations could be a sizable task for the Cavaliers.\n\nThomas has been rehabilitating a hip injury that ended his season in the Eastern Conference finals, and sources have told ESPN that he has yet to begin a regimen of running this offseason.\n\nIf the deal falls apart, Boston would have to count on using its arsenal of draft picks, Crowder and other assets to bring it another point guard in a future trade -- if Thomas isn't the long-term answer. Still, it is unlikely that the Celtics could find a point guard of Thomas' stature on the market -- never mind Irving's.\n\nHow Thomas and Crowder's psyches would be affected upon a vetoed trade returning them to Boston is a factor in this process too. Cleveland could be facing a bigger challenge bringing Irving, 25, back into the contentious Cavaliers situation.\n\nHe asked for a trade and has wanted no part of a return to the Cavaliers. Cleveland would need to quickly re-engage potential teams around the league on trade scenarios again. The Cavaliers could ultimately help themselves in the short term by moving Irving to one of the several Western Conference teams with whom they had discussed deals.\n\nThis way, the Cavaliers wouldn't be fortifying the biggest threat to their Eastern Conference supremacy, Boston, in the final year before James could leave in free agency. Still, Boston had offered Cleveland the deal it most wanted -- which included a draft pick that is likely better than any other available to the Cavaliers on the market.", "source_url": "http://www.espn.com", "date": "None", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Niall Seewang", "Kevin Pelton", "Nick Depaula", "Royce Young", "Espn Com", "Adrian Wojnarowski"], "images": ["http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2017/0822/r247793_608x342_16-9.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center", "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0822%2Fr247795_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/columnists/full/wojnarowski_adrian.png&w=160&h=160&scale=crop", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2016/1216/r163581_600x400_3-2.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/500/nba.png&w=80&h=80&transparent=true", "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2017/0824/r248133_2_608x342_16-9.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center"]}, {"title": "Jay Gruden sees nothing wrong $24M QB Kirk Cousins attempting preseason tackles", "text": "The Redskins are paying quarterback Kirk Cousins $24 million this season to make clutch throws, not play defensive back.\n\nHe did neither very well in a second-quarter play during Sunday's preseason game at FedEx Field against the Bengals.

I think if you're the Bengals, you consider this a win despite a 23-17 final score in favor of the Redskins. Once viewed as an incomplete product, this offense is finally starting to make sense to me -- and apparently the Redskins, who allowed a 15-play touchdown drive on Cincinnati's first offensive possession of the day. Dalton could not miss A.J. Green early, which is a welcome sign for the Pro Bowl wideout who missed six games a year ago. In 2016, Green was being targeted 10 times per game by Dalton, and stunningly that number could actually rise if rookie wideout John Ross can extract some pressure. Dalton and Ross do not seem to have their timing down just yet on the deep route -- one pass sailed about 10 yards past the speedy Ross -- though Ross missed significant time early in camp. By the time Dalton and Ross have their mechanics down, this could be a scary starting 11.\n\n1a. Ross, by the way, was utilized in a jet-sweep type play with the starting offense. This confirms the obvious in his debut: The Bengals will get him the ball any way possible.\n\n2. Joe Mixon seems to be the glue holding this all together. The Bengals have the deepest running back depth chart in football, and won't be afraid to feature Mixon like a primary every-down back. His juke move on Josh Norman -- a cherry atop an otherwise impressive 6-yard run -- was professional-grade. His lone error, a fumble caused by Mixon closing his arms just a second too early, was forgivable.\n\n3. There are no words:\n\n4. Terrelle Pryor eventually redeemed himself with a tough catch -- his second of the preseason -- but I'm not convinced his addition is enough to offset the losses of Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson. Pryor's route-running ability has come a long way, but Kirk Cousins is going to need him to be more than a nice conversion project; he's going to need Pryor to carry certain possessions. In fairness, Washington was asking Pryor to go over the middle quite a bit on Sunday, and it's difficult to gauge those routes when the games don't impact the final standings.\n\n5. Speaking to reporters after the game, tight end Jordan Reed (toe) said he felt good in his debut. From afar, he looked comfortable pushing off the sprained toe and flashed some of his trademark speed. He caught two passes for 12 yards.\n\n6. A random note on Cousins: After getting plowed by Dre Kirkpatrick on a cornerback blitz, Cousins opted to keep the ball on the next play (what looked to me like a zone-read handoff) and run for the first down. When he tossed the pick-six to Vontaze Burfict (a beautiful bait and read by the Bengals linebacker) Cousins was the closest one to making a tackle. He chased Burfict all the way to the end zone.\n\n1. I think your final takeaway from Sunday's 49ers/Vikings game depends on how you feel about San Francisco's defense. If you believe in the combination of Solomon Thomas, Arik Armstead and DeForest Buckner and that defensive coordinator Robert Saleh is delivering on his promise to create a violent defense, then it wasn't too depressing to watch the Vikings' offensive line get run over. If the Buckner/Thomas/Armstead era is still a year or two from taking off, and were made to look as good as they were last night because of the Vikings offensive line, then this was a red-alert game. Sam Bradford (17-of-21, 134 yards) was on the run, at one point getting knocked down when his own offensive lineman was thrown into his chest. Dalvin Cook has shown an ability to pick up stray blitzers, but this is not going to be enough to keep Bradford off the ground.\n\n1.a. As the St. Paul Pioneer Press noted Sunday night: 11 possessions for the Vikings first-team offense, 3 total points.\n\n2. Reuben Foster lived up to the hype on Sunday night. The rookie linebacker delivered two memorable pops, first on Cook after Bradford floated a late outlet pass, and again later on in the half on Laquon Treadwell. Foster has that classic thumper lineage but has certainly proven himself open and agile when facing quicker targets in the open field.\n\n3. The 49ers remind me a bit of the Browns this preseason defensively. There is a lot to like -- a person projecting potential over time would take their chances with a roster like this. However, it's difficult to buy into an identity just yet. Seeing Foster blow people up Sunday, or even safety Eric Reid coming down and delivering some Kam Chancellor-esque hits was enticing -- but what does it really mean come Sept. 10 against the Panthers?\n\n4. Another what does it really mean statement: Brian Hoyer looked incredible on Sunday. Hoyer started the game 9-of-9 for 152 yards and a pair of touchdowns. A few quick slants to Pierre Garcon set up this beautiful 46-yard bomb to Marquise Goodwin. Former NFL player Matt Bowen breaks the route concept down well here. If Shanahan was able to assemble just a microcosm of Atlanta's offense in San Francisco this year, how good could the 49ers be?\n\n5. The rumors of a more in-shape Carlos Hyde seem to be true. The 49ers' workhorse sliced through Minnesota's defense on a 7-route for Hoyer's second touchdown of the night. Players return to camp every summer claiming their change in diet or workout regimen have them prepared to play the best football of their lives. Hyde's burst and breakaway speed seem to have proven that true in Hyde's case.", "source_url": "http://www.nfl.com", "date": "None", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Conor Orr"], "images": ["https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/CHI.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/ARI.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/OAK.svg", "http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/08/27/0ap3000000835689_thumbnail_200_150.jpg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/SEA.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/IND.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/JAX.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/CIN.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/CAR.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/ATL.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/SF.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/BAL.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/DAL.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/GB.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/BUF.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/NE.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/KC.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/LA.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/NO.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/WAS.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/HOU.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/MIN.svg", "http://i.nflcdn.com/static/site/7.5/img/news/email-card-title.png", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/NYJ.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/DEN.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/CLE.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/TB.svg", "http://i.nflcdn.com/static/site/7.5/img/news/partner-type/twit-logo.jpg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/TEN.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/PIT.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/application-shell/ic_search_eee.svg", "http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2014/10/09/0ap3000000408080.jpg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/MIA.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/LAC.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/NYG.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/DET.svg", "https://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/static/wildcat/assets/img/logos/teams/PHI.svg"]}, {"title": "How to break free from the Apple ecosystem", "text": "The iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch make for a great team, as they work with each other to streamline common tasks and make them easier to do. However, there are several reasons you might want to explore other options, like Android phones and Windows computers. The main reason that comes to mind is Apple's ecosystem is getting increasingly expensive to stay in. Just take the 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro laptops. They're well over $1,000 even for the base model, whereas you could get a MacBook Pro for under $1,000 back in the day. Whatever your reason might be, leaving the Apple ecosystem can be a tough thing to do, and you might not find some of the useful features from the Apple ecosystem anywhere else. To make the transition easier, though, here are a few tips to start with: View As: One Page Slides\n\n1. First, you'll need new, non-Apple devices.\n\nThe computer. If you use software that isn't your web browser, your best bet is going to be a Windows 10 laptop. There are several Windows 10 laptops out there you might like at different price ranges. Here are five Windows 10 laptops that outprice the new MacBooks Pros, as well as out-speccing them. Those laptops I suggest in the link above are pretty powerful, but while they're also pricey, they're still less expensive than the new MacBook Pros. There are a bunch of great Windows 10 laptops in the $700 range that aren't as powerful; those could fit your needs, too. If 99% of the things you do on your Mac are based in a web browser, you could consider Chromebooks. They run Chrome OS, which is essentially the Chrome web browser, and they can cost a lot less than a Windows 10 laptop.\n\nThe phone. There are a bunch of great Android phones, but if I had to pick one, it would be Google's own Pixel or Pixel XL. It's the purest expression of what Google thinks a smartphone should be, and you'll get the latest Android and security updates directly from Google as they're released, not several months later like the majority of Android smartphones.\n\nThe smartwatch. If you have an Apple Watch, the bad news is that it's not compatible with anything else apart from Apple products. If you must have a smartwatch, go for Samsung's Gear S3 Classic or Frontier. They work with most recent Android smartphones, and they're very good as far as smartwatches go. And if you get a Samsung smartphone, you can use Samsung Pay with the Gear S3, too, which works in pretty much any store that has a credit card reader. Unfortunately, however, you won't find the useful Auto Unlock feature from the Apple ecosystem, which unlocks your Mac computer when you're wearing your Apple Watch.\n\n3. Now, transfer stuff from your Mac to your new computer.\n\nYou can use a good ol' fashioned hard drive. Just plug the hard drive in to your old Mac, transfer your files and folders, and unload them into your new machine. This only works for Windows PCs, though; for Chromebook owners, your best bet will be to use Google Drive (more on that in a bit).\n\nIf you have a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, you get a ton of free OneDrive cloud storage to transfer your files and folders from your Mac to your Windows machine. You get a free terabyte (1,000 GB) of storage in Microsoft's OneDrive if you subscribe to Office 365 for things like Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. That should be plenty of storage for all your files and folders on your Mac. To transfer everything, go to OneDrive and log in with your Office 365 login details. Then, start clicking and dragging your files and folders into OneDrive on your Mac's web browser.\n\nIf you're switching to a Chromebook, or you want to move stuff to your new Windows PC without Office 365, use Google Drive, which has 15GB of free storage. On your Mac's web browser, go to Google Drive and sign in with your Google account. Then, you can click and drag files and folders from your Mac to Google Drive in your web browser. You can buy more storage if you need more than the free included 15 GB. It's not very expensive at $2 per month for 100 GB.\n\n4. Switch from Apple's Messages to a universal messaging service, like Google Hangouts. Having Messages on the Mac to send and receive texts you're also getting on your phone is a pretty tough feature to leave behind if you're ditching the Apple ecosystem, especially since you could get standard SMS messages on your Mac \u2013 not just iMessages between Apple devices \u2013 after OS X Yosemite was released. Unfortunately, Windows 10 doesn't have an equivalent native app that will work with Android phones to send and receive text messages. There are some third-party apps, like mySMS, which received decent reviews, but they're not ideal or as good as Messages on Macs. To send quick messages to your contacts from both your computer and your phone, the best solution is to use a messenger app that's cross-platform (available on both computers and phones, just like iMessages) rather than using text messages at all. It helps to use a service where many of your contacts are likely to have accounts, like Facebook or Google. Google Hangouts is a great messenger app that also has video and voice chat. It's not quite the same thing as getting your actual phone calls on your Mac based on your actual phone number, but it's a pretty good alternative. You can use Hangouts from your Gmail account online, the Android app, or from the Hangouts web app.\n\nFacebook's Messenger also works across all your devices, and it features video and voice-calling, too.\n\nUse Android Pay instead of Apple Pay. Most new Android devices support Android Pay, which is pretty much the same thing as Apple Pay. Android Pay is often accepted in the same places as Apple Pay due to the fact that both use NFC technology to make mobile payments. If you get a Samsung smartphone that comes with Samsung Pay, it's even better than Apple Pay and Android Pay, as it's accepted pretty much any store that has a credit card reader. The technology used for Samsung Pay, called MST (magnetic secure transmission), mimics a credit card's magnetic stripe, so there's no need for stores to upgrade credit card readers that support NFC for mobile payments. Unlike Apple Pay, however, which you can use on from your Mac, you can only use Android Pay with your smartphone.\n\n5. Use Spotify instead of iTunes and Apple Music. Spotify is a great, if not better, alternative to Apple Music as a music streaming service. However, many of you out there have probably amassed vast libraries of music through iTunes, and it's understandable why you wouldn't want to ditch it. The good news is that you can upload your iTunes music that's locally stored on your computer and iPhone onto Spotify on your Mac \u2014 or, if you've already made the switch to a Windows machine or Android phone, you can do it there, too. To get your iTunes music onto Spotify via Mac, just download Spotify and get a Premium account. Then, go into Preferences, and make sure your iTunes Music library is selected as a Local File Source. Once you've done that, just grab any tracks that pop up in your Local Files tab and drag them over to My Music. That way, you can stream them from any device, including whatever non-Apple device you happen to buy in the future. To get your iTunes music onto Spotify via Windows, you'll need to download and install iTunes on your PC, which seems counter-intuitive, but it'll make sense soon. Then, the easiest option to get your purchased iTunes music onto your new Windows Machine is to download it again from iTunes. You can find all your purchased music from your account in iTunes. Note that this only works for music you bought from iTunes. If you have local music files from elsewhere, you'll need to transfer it from your Mac to Windows machine with a hard drive, Google Drive, or OneDrive. Once you have all your iTunes music on your Windows machine, download and install the Spotify app for Windows. From there, you simply need to go to Spotify's settings > scroll down until you find the Local Files menu, and turn on the \"source\" where your local iTunes music is stored on your Windows machine. Now, Spotify will be your new music player complete with playlists, even for music from your iTunes library. To get your iTunes music onto an Android phone, the best way is to start from your Windows machine. From your Windows machine, put all your local iTunes music files into a playlist in Spotify. Then, you'll need Spotify's paid Premium service to get them onto your Android phone. Get the Android app, sign up for a Premium account, and make sure your Windows machine and Android phone are on the same WiFi network. Then, in the Spotify Android app, go to Your Library > Playlists > then select the playlist with all your iTunes music, and switch the Download button to the green \"On\" position. If everything goes well, that's all there is to it! It's not the most convenient or effortless thing to do, but that's the price for sticking with local music files!", "source_url": "http://www.businessinsider.com", "date": "2017-08-27", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-boas"], "images": ["http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/57b618b8ce38f231008b79ce-100-100/antonio-villas-boas.jpg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/assets/images/logos/BI-placeholder.svg", "http://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://static6.businessinsider.com/image/589df07f8e91c66f5d9dffd1-700/ignition-future-of-digital-free.png", "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/58793a2df10a9a29768b5408-1190-625/how-to-break-free-from-the-apple-ecosystem.jpg", "http://static2.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/logos/logo-print-v1.png", "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/51e9584f69beddbb1d000003-208/appstorebadgeen.png", "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/598cd29dcb970121008b47f6-60/fidelity-sector-expert-reports-of-a-stock-bubble-are-exaggerated.jpg", "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5876a243f10a9a1c008b7eb2-1600/undefined", "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5876a243f10a9a1c008b7eb2-100-100/how-to-break-free-from-the-apple-ecosystem.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/588bab028d3eae7c079a16b6/30-big-tech-predictions-for-2017-report-cover-free.png", "http://static4.businessinsider.com/assets/images/transparent.gif", "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/57d95e358b987d18049f3f06-300/google-play.png", "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/59653cb9abc1c819008b46bb-60/heres-how-much-you-need-to-save-for-college-every-year-depending-on-when-you-start.jpg"]}, {"title": "Setup ADB and Fastboot to be used anywhere on your Windows or Linux PC", "text": "How to Use ADB or Fastboot From Any Directory on your Windows/Linux PC\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed our tutorial on how to setup the adb and fastboot platform tools on your computer, it might be annoying to have to navigate to the folder every time, especially if you use either tool quite frequently. Having to copy files to the platform tools folder is also annoying whenever you want to flash stuff on your device. For me it\u2019s frustrating as I use an SSD and I dislike having to copy my files to my platform tools folder, and then delete them after. However, it\u2019s possible to run the adb or fastboot tools from any directory on your Windows or Linux PC so you\u2019ll never have to change directories to run any commands.\n\nWhat is the PATH system variable?\n\nPATH is used by Windows to specify the location of important executables. Usually, these are files located in the system directories, such as C:\\Windows and C:\\Windows\\system32. This is why you can type \u201ccalc\u201d in the command prompt to launch calculator, but not \u201cchrome\u201d to launch Google Chrome. This variable is sometimes changed by applications when you install them, such as Java. Java adds itself to the PATH variable on installation, meaning you can use Java from any directory. This is useful to people using Java applications so the program does not have to attempt to hard code the Java location.\n\nWe will be modifying the PATH system variable to allow us to use adb or Fastboot anywhere on our Windows computer. PATH also exists on Linux and usually contains the bin and sbin directories. I will cover how to add the platform tools to the Linux PATH variable too.\n\nNote: Both tutorials require administrator/sudo access. Adding to Windows has two methods. I strongly suggest the first, but both work fine and the second is better if you plan to use the PATH variable a lot.\n\nAdding adb and Fastboot to the Windows PATH (Method 1)\n\nThis isn\u2019t really adding it to the Windows PATH variable per se, but more adding it to a folder that is already in the PATH variable. Simply copy your adb.exe, fastboot.exe, AdbWinApi.dll and AdbWinUsbApi.dll to C:\\Windows and you\u2019re good to go. You should be able to run adb and fastboot from the command line now. This is by far the easiest, most fool proof method for setting this up. If for whatever reason it doesn\u2019t work, follow method 2.\n\nAdding adb and Fastboot to the Windows PATH (Method 2)\n\nStep 1\n\nOpen Windows Explorer and right click \u201cMy PC\u201d. Select \u201cProperties\u201d and you will be greeted with a screen showing some system information.\n\nStep 2\n\nSelect \u201cAdvanced System Settings\u201d.\n\nStep 3\n\nSelect \u201cEnvironment Variables\u201d\n\nStep 4\n\nLook for the variable named \u201cPath\u201d and double click it.\n\nStep 5\n\nClick \u201cBrowse\u201d and navigate to the folder where you extracted your adb files. Next \u201cokay\u201d out of all of the Windows you have open. Start a new PowerShell or command prompt and type \u201cadb\u201d to verify the location has been added. If not, reboot your PC and try again.\n\nPlease ensure before you click \u201cBrowse\u201d that no field is highlighted. If a field is highlighted you will end up replacing it. Click somewhere in the list that doesn\u2019t contain an entry to ensure that you do not replace a field.\n\nAdding adb and Fastboot to the Linux PATH\n\nI will be using Ubuntu for this tutorial, via command line only. You can edit the .bashrc file via the GUI, but you will need to navigate to the root of your home directory and press Ctrl+H. Make sure you have the platform-tools downloaded and extracted.\n\nStep 1\n\nNote the path of the adb tools you extracted. For me, I extracted them to /home/adam/adb/platform-tools.\n\nStep 2\n\nYou\u2019ll need to edit your .bashrc file. Go back to your home directory and run the following command.\n\nsudo nano .bashrc\n\nIf you prefer to use vi or gedit you can instead.\n\nStep 3\n\nAdd the following line to the end of the .bashrc file. Be careful editing this file, do not add anything else or change anything else.\n\nexport PATH=${PATH}:/home/YOUR-USERNAME/path/to/adb\n\nAnd type\n\nadb\n\nto check if it works. If it gives you an error (usually on 64-bit computers), install the packages glibc.i686 and libstdc++ and it should work.\n\nDone!\n\nYou are now done, you should now be able to simply execute the adb or fastboot commands from anywhere on your Windows or Linux computer. As I said, this is incredibly useful and also allows for better organization so that you don\u2019t need to put all of your flashable files in the same folders.", "source_url": "https://www.xda-developers.com", "date": "2017-08-27", "fake or real": "R", "authors": [], "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=403489180002579&ev=PageView_XDA&noscript=1", "https://static.swappa.com/images/dynamic/google-pixel-xl_44x90.png", "https://static.swappa.com/images/dynamic/google-nexus-6p_44x90.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/04/micro-sd-card-75x75_c.jpg", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/08/Image-023-75x75_c.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0c8e64810f94f4dfb6896834bc4cd685?s=100&d=mm&r=g", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/01/BlackBerry-World-Feature-Image-XDA-Portal-Red-75x75_c.png", "https://forum.xda-cdn.com/images/2015/xda-logo_newcolors.svg", "https://forum-lw-1.xda-cdn.com/images/2015/swappaphone.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/07/maze3-250x125_c.jpg", "https://static.swappa.com/images/dynamic/samsung-galaxy-note-5_45x90.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/08/usbdebugging-75x75_c.png", "https://forum.xda-cdn.com/images/2015/G-Plus.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/08/usbdebugging.png", "https://forum.xda-cdn.com/images/2015/xdalogo-dark.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/08/minimal-added.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/06/Adhell-is-a-Free-Open-Source-Ad-Blocker-for-Samsung-Devices-75x75_c.png", "https://forum-lw-1.xda-cdn.com/images/2015/swappa_50.png", "https://static.swappa.com/images/dynamic/samsung-galaxy-s8_41x90.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/08/usbdebugging-810x298_c.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/08/environment-variables.png", "https://forum.xda-cdn.com/images/oneplus-badge-8.jpg", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/08/properties.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/08/advanced-system-settings-1024x241.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/03/IMG_20170304_130347-250x125_c.jpg", "https://static.swappa.com/images/dynamic/oneplus-3t-black_44x90.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/08/path.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2014/04/leaseweb_orig_175x50.png", "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/06/sony_xperia_xa-250x125_c.jpeg"]}, {"title": "How Luke Skywalker Learns About Rogue One Crew's Sacrifice", "text": "The Rebel efforts in Rogue One are being recognized by Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo in a new Star Wars comic book. Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, K-2SO, and the others retrieved the Death Star plans and gave them to the Rebel Alliance in Rogue One, starting the downfall of the Imperial forces led by Emperor Palpatine. Their efforts resulted in the destruction of the holy city on Jedha with the rest of the planet being devastated and now Luke, Leia, Han Solo, and Chewie will learn about the Rebel sacrifices in a new story written by Kieron Gillen and Salvador Larroca.\n\nGillen and Larroca have written Star Wars issue number 38 and talked to CBR about the new story and revealed that Luke Skywalker will learn the truth behind Rogue One. Gillen explains.\n\n\"Through that we get people like Luke discovering everything that allowed him to get into a position to destroy the Death Star. He finds out about Jyn Erso and all the people who sacrificed their lives to give him the chance to be a hero. As you can imagine, that's going to hit Luke hard.\"\n\nThe new story takes place between the events of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes BackThe Empire Strikes Back} and will throw the crew of the Millennium Falcon in a post-apocalyptic wasteland on Jedha. Gillen had this to say.\n\n\"Then Luke is searching for the spirituality of the Jedi and he's taken to a big hole where their holiest site used to be. That's an enormous visual that expresses the problem that Luke is facing. What he's looking for isn't there anymore.\"\n\nThe synopsis for the new Star Wars issue number 38 reads: The Rebel Alliance turns its attention to the shattered planet of Jedha! Once the site of great significance to the Jedi, Jedha was left in ruins when the Death Star annihilated the Holy City there. Now, new series writer Kieron Gillen joins artist Salvador Larroca to bring Luke, Leia, Han, and the rest to the remains of the tragic victim of the Empire's fury! The story of Rogue One is an important one, so it's cool to see that their story will be recognized by the Star Wars universe.\n\nWhen asked if anybody survived the Death Star attack on Jedha, Gillen goes into more detail about the new story. He explains.\n\n\"The Rogue One crew survived it, so there's a good chance others did as well. Also, Jedha City wasn't the only settlement on the planet. Those other settlements though are in shall we say . . . a pretty poor state right now.\"\n\nGillen also went on to talk about the Empire coming back to Jedha as well. He explains that the Empire has a new reason to head back to the city. Gillen had this to say.\n\n\"There are reasons why the Empire thinks it needs to go back to Jedha. They took all the Khyber Crystals from the planet and now they're coming back for something else. That's prompted what would be best described as a neo-partisan movement.

Even mundane or largely useless statistics can be immensely interesting to people. With adb, or root and a terminal application, it\u2019s possible to view the boot count of your phone which is how many times you\u2019ve started your device! Obviously, this counter is only logged since your phone has been last factory reset. This data is stored in the settings database, so wiping your data in a factory reset means this boot counter is lost. If following the root method below, you will need Magisk or SuperSU. The value that is read, \u201cBOOT_COUNT\u201d, was only added in SDK24, or Android Nougat, so any devices on Android Nougat or Android Oreo will have this counter. Those on Android Marshmallow or lower cannot use this tutorial, as the string does not exist.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re really missing out on much, though.\n\nSee your Boot Count on any Android 7.0+ Device (No Root)\n\nFirstly, follow this tutorial to set up adb on your device. It has everything you need to get it up and running for Windows, Mac or Linux! Once you\u2019ve got all of that setup, you\u2019ll need to run the following two commands via adb. You can check if your device is connected as well with \u201cadb devices\u201d. The image on the right shows you how it should look.\n\nadb shell\n\nsettings get global boot_count\n\nThat should then give you back an integer value, which is how many times your device has booted.\n\nSee your Boot Count on any Android 7.0+ Device (Root)\n\nYou need root for this one, so type the following commands in Termux (or any terminal application). The image on the right shows you how it should look.\n\nsu\n\nAccept the prompt to grant superuser access.\n\nsettings get global boot_count\n\nAnd that\u2019s all!\n\nWith Android Nougat, the string \u201cBOOT_COUNT\u201d was added. This is a string which records the boot count of your device. As mentioned above, this string is wiped if you factory reset. If you care about this minor boot statistic, I suggest not wiping your /data partition. But you probably don\u2019t really care. Maybe.\n\nWhat\u2019s your boot count?

To celebrate its release, we recently caught up with actress Vanessa Marshall to talk about the show and what's to come for Hera moving forward. We'll bring you the full interview soon but in the meantime, here's an excerpt in which she addresses Hera's cameo in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.\n\n\n\nIt was in that movie that Hera showed up (well, sort of) when an announcement went out in the Rebel base asking for her. Chopper could also be seen as could The Ghost, the ship belonging to Hera and the cast of the popular Disney series. Here's what Vanessa had to say about finding out about the scene.\n\n\n\n\"Fantastic, I almost started crying. I had to remember I was in a public place and had to contain myself. I thought I was losing my mind and started asking, 'Did that really just happen?' I went to see it a million times and every time, I was just blown away. It's good to know that she still exists at that point, so that's a good thing, but also being such a huge fan of every Star Wars film that's been released, having a character I've played in an animated series be mentioned...it was really rewarding.\"\n\n\n\nAs for whether or not she'd like to play Hera in live-action somewhere down the line, the actress was obviously enthusiastic about the prospect but ultimately wants what is best for the beloved character.\n\n\"Of course! Who knows, if she can serve the narrative, it would be awesome. It would be great to see her on film and it was incredible to see Saw Gerrera come to life. I loved Saw in the Alderaan arcs in The Clone Wars and was so thrilled they took a character from the animated series and transitioned him into live-action to play such a pivotal role. If they did that with Hera, that would be magnificent but it's all about what serves the narrative and not necessarily just let's give Hera a cameo. I bow down to the overall journey at hand and I really can't wait for the movie to come out in December and I'm so excited. That's really what's keeping me going [Laughs].\"", "source_url": "https://www.comicbookmovie.com", "date": "None", "fake or real": "R", "authors": [], "images": ["https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/pictures/1652S.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-83EhIeXupCjRA.gif", "https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/articles/153500.jpg", "https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/pictures/1651S.jpg", "https://gamefragger.com/images/ads/gf/300x125(default).png", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18295657&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/transparent.gif", "https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/articles/153502.jpg", "https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/pictures/1650S.jpg", "https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/articles/153504.jpg", "http://a.dilcdn.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/06/star-wars-rebels-season-3-blu-ray.jpg", "https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/articles/153497.jpg", "https://gamefragger.com/images/ads/cbm/300x125(default).png", "https://s2.postimg.org/kef4uijp5/Hera.jpg", "https://ads.intergi.com/adserv|3.0|5205.1|4418409|0|509|ADTECH;loc=300;key=key1+key2+key3+key4;alias=", "https://animemojo.com/images/ads/gf/300x125(default).png", "https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/pictures/1653S.jpg", "https://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/loading.gif"]}, {"title": "Police searching for suspicious Palestinian in Ashkelon", "text": "Police have located suspicious Palestinian in Ashkelon\n\nA large number of Israel Police forces were in Ashkelon searching for a suspicious Palestinian man who is residing in Israel illegally on Sunday.

You visit a website where a banner encourages you to download a mobile app. And you don\u2019t want to do it \u2014 not because you have anything against apps, but because you don\u2019t want to hop out to the Play Store to download that app, then launch it, then find the thing you were looking for again.\n\nCredit: GoogleInstant Apps is a neat technology from Google that offers a nice compromise. An app developer can create an Android app in a special way, breaking it up into small chunks that support individual \u201cactivities\u201d (like watching a video or buying a product), as long as each activity requires downloading less than 4MB. If an app is structured to support Instant Apps, then you don\u2019t have to go to the Play Store at all. Just go to a website, and you\u2019ll automatically download the tiny app piece necessary for the activity you\u2019re doing, seamlessly.\n\nMORE: Best Android-Only Apps You Can't Find on iPhone\n\nInstant Apps is available on most Android devices running Marshmallow (Android 6.0) or later, as long as you have a recent version of Play Services. That's hundreds of millions of devices capable of downloading Instant Apps. But you need to enable the feature first. Here\u2019s how to do that, along with how to know if a site or service supports Instant Apps.\n\n1. Open Settings and tap on Google in the Personal section.\n\n\n\n2. Scroll down until you find Instant Apps and tap on it. If you don\u2019t see Instant Apps, the feature is not yet supported on your device.\n\n\n\n3. Flip the toggle to On. You should see your Google account listed at the top. If you have multiple accounts, this is where you select which account you want to use when you download Instant Apps. This is also the page where any Instant Apps you use will be listed.\n\n\n\n4. Agree to the terms. Just tap \u201cYes, I\u2019m in\u201d if you want to use Instant Apps.\n\nNow that you've turned on Instant Apps, how do you use it? It\u2019s simple.\n\nFirst, look for something on the web. Websites that have supported Instant Apps are marked with the word \u201cInstant\u201d next to their search result. There are a few exceptions: A Vimeo video thumbnail, for example, may not say \u201cInstant\u201d even though Vimeo\u2019s app supports Instant Apps. There are quite a few supported apps, such as Wish, Jet, the NY Times Crossword, and Periscope, with many more on the way.\n\nYou can usually tell what sites have associated Instant Apps in the Google search results.The first time you open a site with an Instant App, you\u2019ll be prompted to use it or just go to the website. Just tap Open App, it\u2019s nearly as fast as loading the site and usually a better experience.When you\u2019re using an Instant App, you\u2019ll see a small lightning bolt icon in the upper left of the status bar. Instant Apps act like real apps, so Google reminds you that you\u2019re using one in the status bar.If you want to see which Instant Apps have been installed on your device, just hop back to the Settings menu where you first enabled the toggle. As you use Instant Apps, the list will grow.If you want to download the full app or delete the Instant App for one of these, just tap on it. You can select \u201cInstall\u201d to get a Google Play card that will let you immediately install it, or \u201cClear App Data\u201d to remove the Instant App and all its associated Data.\n\nYou can easily download the full app, keeping all your settings and data, or delete the Instant App.One of the nice things about Instant Apps is that they\u2019re pieces of full apps, and share data. So if you download the full app, your settings and logins and actions will carry over.", "source_url": "https://www.tomsguide.com", "date": "2017-08-27", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Tom S Guide Staff", "Philip Michaels", "Sean Riley", "Jason Cross"], "images": ["https://img.purch.com/o/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWcucHVyY2guY29tL3IvMTAweDEwMC9hSFIwY0RvdkwyMHVZbVZ6ZEc5bWJXVmthV0V1WTI5dEwzTm1jQzlwYldGblpYTXZaR1Z6YVdkdUwyNXZhVzFuTDI1dkxYQnliMlpwYkMweE1EQjRNVEF3TG1wd1p3PT0=", "https://img.purch.com/o/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWcucHVyY2guY29tL3cvNTAwL2FIUjBjRG92TDIxbFpHbGhMbUpsYzNSdlptMXBZM0p2TG1OdmJTOVRMMWt2TnpBMk1EWTJMMjl5YVdkcGJtRnNMM056WkdWMmFXTmxMVEUxTURNMk56Z3dPRGcyTkRndWFuQm4="]}, {"title": "Iran building missile production sites in Syria, Lebanon", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (R) gestures as he delivers a joint statement with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Jerusalem August 28, 2017. REUTERS/Heidi Levine/Pool\n\nBy Jeffrey Heller\n\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Iran is building sites to produce precision-guided missiles in Syria and Lebanon, with the aim of using them against Israel.\n\nAt the start of a meeting in Jerusalem with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Netanyahu accused Iran of turning Syria into a \"base of military entrenchment as part of its declared goal to eradicate Israel.\"\n\n\"It is also building sites to produce precision-guided missiles towards that end, in both Syria and in Lebanon. This is something Israel cannot accept. This is something the U.N. should not accept,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nIran, Israel's arch-enemy, has been Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's staunchest backer and has provided militia fighters to help him in Syria's civil war.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Iran.\n\nIsrael has pointed to Tehran's steadily increasing influence in the region during the six-year-old Syrian conflict, whether via its own Revolutionary Guard forces or Shi'ite Muslim proxies, especially Hezbollah.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu, in a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Israel was prepared to act unilaterally to prevent an expanded Iranian military presence in Syria.\n\nRussia, also an Assad ally, is seen as holding the balance of power in achieving a deal on Syria's future. Israel fears an eventual Assad victory could leave Iran with a permanent garrison in Syria, extending a threat posed from neighboring Lebanon by Hezbollah.\n\nNetanyahu accused Iran of building the production sites two weeks after an Israeli television report showed satellite images it said were of a facility Tehran was constructing in northwest Syria to manufacture long-range rockets.\n\nThe Channel 2 News report said the images were of a site near the Mediterranean coastal town of Baniyas and were taken by an Israeli satellite.\n\nIn parallel to lobbying Moscow, Israel has been trying to persuade Washington that Iran and its guerrilla partners, not Islamic State, pose the greater common threat in the region.\n\n(Additional reporting and editing by Maayan Lubell; Editing by Richard Balmforth)", "source_url": "https://www.yahoo.com", "date": "2017-08-28", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller"], "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1v57GsbtrMbwZhM8ZPilPg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODQ7aD04NDtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2017-02-01/973af590-e89a-11e6-b294-9bc8096ac008_reuters.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1KlbeC5mLjizCCqCYARrRQ--/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2017-08-28T103308Z_1_LYNXNPED7R0MV_RTROPTP_2_MIDEAST-CRISIS-NETANYAHU.JPG", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QAON9XCQfiz5soYPW.9qWw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NDUwO2g9MzAwO2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2017-08-28T103308Z_1_LYNXNPED7R0MV_RTROPTP_2_MIDEAST-CRISIS-NETANYAHU.JPG.cf.jpg"]}, {"title": "Star Wars Spinoff Movies Need New Heroes", "text": "It was recently announced that the third instalment in the Star Wars spinoff anthology series would potentially focus on Obi-Wan Kenobi. Not much is known about the project yet \u2014 it\u2019s still in a very early development stage; there\u2019s not even a script. The only real information we have is that Billy Elliot and The Reader director Stephen Daldry is in talks to helm the film.\n\nRELATED: Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi Film Reportedly in Development at Disney\n\nNow it\u2019d take cartoonish levels of cynicism to completely write off a film that doesn\u2019t even exist, and conceptually a film focused on Obi-Wan\u2019s exile isn\u2019t an inherently bad idea \u2014 it\u2019ll most likely focus on Obi-Wan\u2019s exile on Tatooine between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. Daldry knows how to make mature drama films and seems like a good fit for the exiled Jedi. Kenobi is a man who has spent his entire life doing good and helping others, but now has to ignore his altruistic nature. How do you do good when any degree of attention you draw to yourself is dangerous?\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t a bad idea, it is an incredibly safe move, and therein lies the problem. In such an expansive galaxy full of different characters and potential stories, why are they confined to the same dozen characters? If Lucasfilm wants to make an expanded universe, it has to actually expand the universe.\n\nFrom A Certain Point of View\n\nAn Obi-Wan-centric spinoff feels like an exercise in brand recognition as opposed to wanting to tell a unique story from a new perspective. There\u2019s an argument to be made that the film needs to focus on a recognizable character like Obi-Wan Kenobi to bring in an audience, but it\u2019s an argument that also downplays that fact that Star Wars is one of the definitive and immediately recognizable pieces of pop culture of the last century. A film about Obi-Wan has the potential to bring in an audience as much as any film under the Star Wars banner.\n\nIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a shortage of Obi-Wan-focused stories, either \u2014 there\u2019s the Original trilogy, the Prequel trilogy, The Clone Wars animated series, and he even briefly appeared in the most recent season of Star Wars Rebels. In addition, the current ongoing Star Wars comic has been shedding light on Kenobi\u2019s time on Tatooine in brief interludes.\n\nRELATED: Obi Wan: Marvel\u2019s Star Wars Comic Is A Blueprint for the Spinoff Film\n\nWhile The Force Awakens draws a lot of influence from the original trilogy, the characters feel new and unique. They possess some familiar traits but aren\u2019t characters we\u2019ve seen before. Even on the small screen, the animated Star Wars Rebels series is full of original characters; legacy characters like Princess Leia only appear in cameos. Even Rogue One, while not a perfect film, introduced us to new characters. Admittedly, they were mostly one-dimensional, but they had more potential to explore new points of view.\n\nIt\u2019s the same inherent problem with the concept of a young Han Solo: over-explaining a character\u2019s backstory and history when it doesn\u2019t need to be. We don\u2019t need to see Han Solo completing the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs, we don\u2019t need to see Lando bet and lose the Millennium Falcon. We don\u2019t need to know the reason why Chewbacca swore a life-debt to Solo; the specifics aren\u2019t essential to understanding the characters and their relationship. Some things are better left to the imagination. I don\u2019t want to see the entirely possible scene where a young Luke Skywalker accidentally runs into Obi-Wan in Mos Eisley, and then everyone in the theater whispers, \u201cOh my god, that was Luke! That was Luke Skywalker!\u201d\n\nThe insistence on explaining every minute detail was one of the biggest weakness of the pre-Disney expanded universe and falling back into that habit seems like a waste. It\u2019s not creative writing, it\u2019s pandering. We\u2019ve seen Obi-Wan\u2019s story, we know Obi-Wan\u2019s story. In a universe full of unique stories and possibilities, it\u2019d be a laserbrain move to not branch out and explore them.\n\nPage 2:\n\nMy Kind of Scum: Fearless and Inventive\n\nContinue Reading 1 2Next \u00bb\n\nTags: star wars\n\n869 Shares Share On Facebook Tweet Pin It Email", "source_url": "http://www.cbr.com", "date": "2017-08-27", "fake or real": "R", "authors": ["Chris Neill"], "images": ["http://www.cbr.com/wp-content/themes/cbr/css/img/pr-part-of-1.svg", "http://www.cbr.com/wp-content/themes/cbr/css/img/pr-icon-light.svg", "http://www.cbr.com/wp-content/themes/cbr/css/img/pr-go-premium-white.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1639279299697145&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.cbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Obi-Wan-Kenobi.jpg", "http://www.cbr.com/wp-content/themes/cbr/css/img/cbr-logo-color.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21868715&cv=2.0&cj=1"]}, {"title": "WATCH: Tel Aviv fetes four-legged friends with dog day afternoon", "text": "Israelis flocked to Tel Aviv\u2019s Ganei Yehoshua Park on Saturday for the city\u2019s second annual canine celebration, called \u201cKelaviv.\u201d\n\nA steady stream of dogs and owners filed down a long pink carpet alongside the Yarkon River at the entrance to the event, where they were presented with an array of lavish canine products and services.\n\nBooths set up around the perimeter hawked environmentally friendly dog food, vitamins, fitness programs, canine spa visits and Dead Sea dog shampoos.\n\nThere were rustic wooden dog beds for sale and aisles of toys and snacks.\n\nPhotographers took portraits of families posing with their mutts and an artist sold framed sketches of people\u2019s pets.\n\nAttendees congregated on blankets under a tent at the center of the event to listen live music, snack and socialize.\n\nThe event coincided with the US\u2019s National Dog Day, which was founded in 2004 to celebrate canines and encourage adoption.\n\nAn \u201cAdoption Street\u201d near the entrance to Saturday\u2019s festivities advertised for dogs in area shelters alongside puppies in need of care.\n\nTel Aviv prides itself on being a dog-friendly city, with dozens of dog parks scattered throughout the municipality, several dog beaches, and an estimated 30,000 four-legged residents.\n\n\u201cKelaviv\u201d is a combination of the Hebrew word for dog, kelev, and Tel Aviv.

No, these protesters dared to go against the grain and stand up for Ross Geller from the iconic TV show Friends.According to these valiant folks, Ross was treated badly by his girlfriend Rachel Green in the episode \u201cThe One with the Morning After,\u201d in which Ross cheats on Rachel.Or did he? The story goes that Ross and Rachel, one of TV\u2019s greatest couples of all time, were on a break when Ross \u201ccheated\u201d on her.

Taking the satirical protest more seriously than most, Wilsey canceled her flight back to Australia just to attend.\u201cI seriously saw this Facebook event and just said, \u2018Looks like I\u2019m staying in Tel Aviv for another couple days.\u2019 I changed my flight and all \u2013 well worth it \u2013 and we met the absolute best people there and had so many laughs.\u201dAnother protester, in a Galgalatz radio interview, said: \u201cThis is a demonstration for freedom; for the sons of Israel who left Egypt, to watch Friends, and find out that Rachel is angry with Ross because he was with somebody else, while they were on a break!\u201dAdi, an administrator of the Am;lek page told the radio show: \u201cI can\u2019t believe people actually came here.

Head over after watching a show at the adjacent Habima Theater.\n\nThe kiosk boasts a fabulous array of vegan sandwiches with almond spread, basil, sundried tomatoes, avocado and asparagus, while meat lovers can enjoy the decidedly non-kosher bacon sandwiches topped with Emmental cheese in Dijon mustard.\n\nKiosk & Co, corner of Ben-Gurion and Adam Hacohen\n\nThe ultimate go-to joint for late-night drunchies, Kiosk & Co hits the spot with succulent hamburgers, chunky sandwiches heaving with gourmet corned beef and fermented sauerkraut. During the day, mollify the worst of hangovers with a smoothie-cum-lassi comprising yogurt, lemon, celery and an assortment of secret ingredients.\n\nSusu & Sons, corner of Rothschild and Herzl\n\nIf anyone has the chutzpah to try fusing egg salad with a hamburger, it\u2019s celebrity chef Omer Miller of Susu & Sons. Miller\u2019s one-trick-pony kiosk on the corner of Rothschild and Herzl features hamburgers couched in custom-made buns courtesy of boutique bakery Lechem Cham.\n\nAlong with the standard lettuce and tomatoes, these famous and popular burgers are embellished with anything from guacamole to Roquefort or lobster, and seasoned with Susu sauce, whose ingredients, of course, remain hush-hush. The only downside to this fast food joint? It ain\u2019t so fast. Even at 1am there\u2019s a line of people.\n\nMalabi Dajani, 94 Yerushalayim and 16 Shlavim\n\nFor 70 years, the famous Malabi Dajani has offered just three items on its menu: malabi, sachlab and gazoz.\n\nWhile the latter two are beverages of sorts \u2013 a porridgy type drink topped with pistachio and coconut shavings and a flavored seltzer, respectively \u2013 malabi is a dessert, and a divine one at that. The rose-syrup topped, white custard confection is so delicious you\u2019ll forget how strange it is to be eating it standing in the middle of the sidewalk \u2013 because this kiosk has no chairs.\n\nFear not though; in preparation of the forthcoming light rail, which will no doubt wreak havoc on local businesses on Sderot Yerushalayim, this Jaffa staple recently decided to part with tradition and open an additional branch around the corner on Shlavim with actual places to sit.\n\nKanafeh Butke, Carmel Market\n\nMore a stand than a kiosk per se, this is another one for dessert lovers in the heart of the Carmel Market. The surly man selling the honey-based kanafeh and baklava has been there forever, and his flair for the Arabic confection more than makes up for what he lacks in manners.\n\nThe Ben-Gurion corner kiosk, Ben-Gurion and Dizengoff\n\nThe baristas here might be pros at brewing the perfect cup of coffee but ask them their place of employment and they\u2019re stumped. No matter though, because this nameless gem on the corner of one of the busiest intersections in Tel Aviv is always packed regardless.\n\nApart from the usual coffee shop fare, the kiosk offers an interesting menu including miniature egg salad, spinach and truffle sandwiches and Vietnamese snacks. Munch on a giant pretzel with melted cheese and watch the world whizz by.\n\nBayern Market, Sarona Market\n\nJust about the only food that can contend with Bavarian beer is Bavarian food. Head down to Bayern Market, Sarona\u2019s Bavarian street-food kiosk, and stuff yourself silly with sausages \u2013 from weisswurst to Franconia.\n\nAs well as being wiener heaven, Bavaria is also the birthplace of those jumbo pretzels that have become so ubiquitous in Tel Aviv. Grab yourself one of these doughy delights and wash it down with some beer (there are about 4,000 Bavarian brands to choose from).\n\nNordau Kiosk, corner of Nordau and Sokolov\n\nWith the sea breeze rippling into your latte and rays of sun toasting your petit pain-au-chocolat, this is the perfect rest stop after a morning swim. The recently renovated wood-and-brick shack is peopled with cheery baristas and pajama-sporting locals, a solid combination for a lazy Saturday.\n\nPizza Grinberg, 25 Uri Zvi Grinberg, Ezorei Chen\n\nMore of a tiny parlor than a booth, Pizza Grinberg\u2019s appeal is the parking surrounding this place, turning it into an Italian drive-thru.\n\nBoasting 16 types of thin-crust pizza with dozens more toppings and add-ons, it\u2019s no wonder that despite its suburban location this place is always full. Don\u2019t resist a Valentina with Portobello mushrooms, mascarpone, ricotta, and parmesan nestled on a layer of black truffle puree. Oh, and the best part? In August, Pizza Grinberg launched its breakfast menu for the weekends because, well, what better way to start the day than with a pizza? Breakfast of champions.\n\nPronto Kiosko, Shuk Tzafon, 20 Raoul Wallenberg\n\nLocated in the charming Shuk Tzafon, Pronto Kiosko offers the best in handmade, al dente pastas cooked in a myriad of sauces from slow-cooked veal ragout to taboon-grilled chicken in spicy Napolitana. Curb the carbs (or at least allow yourself to think that) by ordering the green pizza topped with fresh broccoli, eggplant, garlic confit, basil and nuts. Got a sweet tooth? Don\u2019t leave without grabbing a chocolate calzone.\n\nCaf\u00e9 Levinsky \u2013 Soda Gazoz, 41 Levinsky\n\nResembling more of a tiny apothecary than a kiosk, Caf\u00e9 Levinsky \u2013 Soda Gazoz (aka Benny Soda) is a boho-chic staple in the heart of the Levinsky Market. Watch mixologist-turned-soda-connoisseur Benny Briga whip up the most mythical, fizzy concoction you\u2019ll ever encounter, with fresh preserves, whole apricots, sprigs of lemongrass, a sprinkling of chia and of course carbonated water. Just don\u2019t bother with particular requests; the customer is definitely not always right when it comes to Briga\u2019s creations.", "source_url": "https://www.israel21c.org", "date": "None", "fake

for Tel Aviv commuters", "text": "Commuters traveling to Tel Aviv are expected to face huge traffic jams over the next week as Israel Railways carries out upgrade work in preparation for the launch of Jerusalem-Tel Aviv express train.\n\nThree of the city\u2019s four major stations \u2013 Herzeliya, Savidor, and University \u2013 will be shuttered until the early morning of Sunday, August 27.\n\nWork began on Thursday morning and commuters had already described the hours-long traffic snarl ups on Sunday to the Yedioth Ahronoth daily as a \u201cterrible nightmare.\u201d\n\nDuring the next week, northbound trains will end at the Savidor Station while service on southbound trains will end at the Bet Yehoshua Station.\n\nOn Sunday, the long-awaited Jerusalem-Tel Aviv express train made its first test run.\n\nWith the line\u2019s journey time expected to last a brisk 28 minutes, the official opening of the new high-speed train line is slated for April 2018.\n\nThe Tel Aviv-Jerusalem rail project, which is projected to cost an estimated NIS 7 billion ($1.8 billion) and has been in the works since 2001, will cut travel time down significantly from the 78-minute ride on the old line built during the days of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe trains will reach speeds of up to 160 kph (100 mph). When fully operational, they will depart every 15 minutes in each direction, carrying up to 1,000 passengers each.\n\nThe massive public works project has faced many hurdles since planning started 15 years ago. Originally slated to be completed in 2008, environmental activists stalled the plans after raising a number of concerns about potential damage to the protected hills and valleys surrounding the capital.\n\nEnvironmental groups tried to force the planners to build a tunnel under the Yitlah Stream instead of passing over it with a bridge. The Interior Ministry\u2019s Planning Commission decided that the tunnel would hold up the project for at least two years, and ruled in favor of Israel Railways.\n\nThe high-speed rail line also crosses the Green Line twice, once near Latrun and once near Mevasseret Zion, inviting criticism from the Israeli left and pro-Palestinian groups. A German company advising the project withdrew in the face of pressure from activists.\n\nThe longest tunnel in the Fast Lane project is 11.6 kilometers (7.2 miles) long, making it the longest tunnel in Israel. A massive German tunnel boring machine drilled each of the tunnels, specially customized to drill in one motion at the size of the tunnel. The machine used 24 motors to drill directly into the hard Jerusalem stone, advancing at a rate of 16 to 20 meters (50 to 65 feet) per day.\n\nIn Mevasseret Zion, the train tracks are 200 meters (650 feet) below ground, as the suburb is perched on hilltops higher than the capital. In Jerusalem, the train station, built near the Central Bus Station, is 80 meters (260 feet) below ground and doubles as a public bomb shelter.\n\nMelanie Lidman contributed to this report.\n\n", "source_url": "http://www.timesofisrael.com", "date": "None", "fake or real": "R", "authors": [], "images": ["http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2016/09/F160903TN26-635x357.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2017/08/000_RW5JH-e1503910401450-85x48.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2017/08/F170704GA20-635x357.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2017/08/DSC7249-e1503233596748-140x79.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2017/08/F170828ABG04-e1503916964149-85x48.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2017/08/F160409CK006-305x172.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/terms-images/writers/Kelvan-Kam-thumbnail.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/terms-images/writers/Wendy-Kalman-thumbnail.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/images/thetimesofisrael-529x60.png", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2015/07/lior-lotan-85x48.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/terms-images/writers/Naomi-Chazan-thumbnail.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2017/08/F170802ADFF03-85x48.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/terms-images/writers/Qanta-Ahmed2-thumbnail.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2016/09/F160903TN26.jpg", "http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/terms-images/writers/Michal-R.-Clune-thumbnail.jpg"]}, {"title": "Lifeguard drowns at Tel Aviv beach", "text": "A lifeguard drowned on Thursday at the Hilton Beach in Tel Aviv, while some of his colleagues abandoned their posts, leading to the closure of lifeguard stations in four of the city's beaches at the peak of the summer and height of tourist visits.\n\nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter\n\n\n\nLifeguard stations were closed in Aviv Beach, Bograshov Beach, Gordon Beach and Mezizim Beach, causing panic among beachgoers as the large waves crashed on the shores without supervision.\n\nAccording to the Tel Aviv Municipality, the lifeguards were not striking as part of an official labor dispute, but rather issuing sick notes and not showing up for work.\n\nBeach in Tel Aviv (Photo: Nitzan Dror)\n\n\u201cThe municipality operates in accordance with the Regulation of Bathing Places Law of the Ministry of the Interior, and in accordance with the new collective agreement signed a year ago for the next ten years,\u201d the municipality said in a statement.\n\nIn the agreement which was signed last year, the bathing season was extended from half a year to eight months, while the salaries of senior lifeguards in Israel were increased by NIS 3,600.\n\nThe lifeguards in Tel Aviv demanded better working benefits as the agreement was hammered out, claiming they are required to work harder than their colleagues keeping an eye out on other beaches scattered along Israel\u2019s Mediterranean coast, and saying that Tel Aviv\u2019s waters are swamped with significantly higher numbers of tourists.\n\nOn Thursday, the lifeguard at Bograshov Beach only arrived at his watch post at 10:30am and the municipality since said that it was not sure whether activities would be able to continue throughout the rest of the day without interruptions.\n\nMDA paramedics attempt to save lifeguard's life (Photo: MDA)\n\nLifeguards operated on the adjacent beaches as usual where the presence of tourists was comparably high.\n\nNevertheless, waves of frustration were recorded by some tourists who expressed anger over the disruptions that had ensued in their activities, particularly as the last few days have witnessed noticeably hostile waters.\n\n\u201cThis is criminal negligence on the part of the municipality,\u201d vented one beachgoer who came to enjoy Tel Aviv\u2019s sandy shores and waves with his wife, only to discover the absence of lifeguards.\n\n\u201cThe sea today is extremely dangerous.

In reality, it\u2019s just the victim of some very unfortunate design and construction processes.\n\nThe station, which is notoriously confusing and easy to get lost in, has both quaint, modern parts as well as abandoned, derelict areas. One of its unused tunnels now houses an urban bat colony, which is supervised by Israel\u2019s Nature and Gardens department.\n\nDuring it\u2019s original conception in the 1960s, the station was supposed to have two floors: one for commerce and one for public transit gates, offering an alternative to Tel Aviv\u2019s former Central Bus Station. A conflict between the two leading bus companies at the time caused the addition of another floor to the plan so there would be one level for each company.\n\nConstruction on the impressively sized building was halted in the 1970s as funding for the project ran out, leaving a massive skeleton of a building taking up a giant part of the neighborhood. New investors were brought in, but to fund the rest of the construction, more retail space had to be added to the floor plan, which was already getting a bit complicated. This process repeated itself several times, with more retail space being tacked onto the existing building each time more funding was required to continue the building\u2019s construction. The station finally opened to the public in 1993 with six floors, over 1,000 shops, and even a movie theater.\n\nThe discovery of high pollution levels on the lower floors led to the construction of a seventh floor on top of the existing building. The new addition blocked off the flow of natural light to the bottom floors and caused a decrease in pedestrian traffic to those areas. Businesses failed and many stores were abandoned. The domino effect cascaded throughout the building. Today, most of the building stands empty, with the majority of stores operating on the passageways between the entrances and transit gates.\n\nHowever, the building is an amazing sight for urban explorers. On certain days of the year, there are organized tours of it that include some of its abandoned, typically closed areas such as the cinema and old, disused platforms.\n\nSome of the things still functioning in the building include a Yiddish museum, art studios, cheap clothing stores, and a synagogue.", "source_url": "http://www.atlasobscura.com", "date": "None", "fake or real": "R",

We took it all in \u2013 from people watching in the achingly cool Neve Tzedek, to enjoying a delicious coffee on Ben Yehuda Street or listening to the shouts of lifeguards on the popular Frishman beach.\n\nEvery day, we enjoyed the vast choices of kosher restaurants and cafes just minutes from our flat: Pizza Fino, a relaxed Italian restaurant on Ben Yehuda Street that even serves up pizza and pasta during Pesach, Suduch, a casual sandwich bar teeming with teenagers right across from the beach, and the fancier L\u2019Entrecote, a dream spot for carnivores.\n\nFoodies should also head straight for the neighbourhood of Sarona, a hotspot for picking up quirky finds and enjoying a varied selection of local and international food. The enormous indoor Sarona Market offers nearly 9,000 square metres of foodie choices. Within it, there are countless speciality food shops, from Asian offerings to European products, while outside, you can pick up everything from books to clothes.\n\nBut as much as your diet will inevitably go out of the window when you visit Tel Aviv, it\u2019s not all about the food.\n\nThere\u2019s a simple joy in strolling the sunny streets, marvelling at the mix of cultures and nationalities eating at bustling outdoor restaurants, the quirky cafes and bars hidden behind plain-seeming facades as well as the sheer number of adorable puppies.\n\nIf you\u2019re into markets, then don\u2019t miss the hustle and bustle of the farmers\u2019 market that takes place every Friday in the Tel Aviv Port and in the Jaffa Port. If you love fresh food and buzzing surroundings, you\u2019ll enjoy the chaos of the open air market: there are plenty of local products to buy, from tahini to honey, as well as restaurants, luxury shops and galleries.\n\nCarmel Market is also worth a visit for its street stalls, and haphazard collection of things for sale, from hummus to carpets.\n\nOnce night falls, it\u2019s time to see why Tel Aviv is one of the Middle East\u2019s best spots for nightlife and head to Allenby Street, where there are more than 20 nightclubs to choose from.\n\nIf you\u2019re after a tamer night, but still want to experience the warm evening, great music and fascinating people-watching, visit the nearby Shenkin Street to enjoy the city\u2019s most stylish cafe-bars.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to capture in words everything that Tel Aviv has to offer. There\u2019s a feeling of excitement, of delights hidden in surprising corners, of constant contrasts.\n\nThe striking Bauhaus buildings you\u2019ll come across when you least expect it. The fact a religious, separate beach is located next to a gay beach. The sleek, polished restaurants and hotels situated smack bang next to cacophonous markets. The taxi drivers who will try to be your best friend while subtly charging you more.\n\nThe hectic buzz of the city is addictive, and we soon found we couldn\u2019t get enough of its heat, of its noise, of its quirks. Yet every day, as we trudged back to Hayarkon with sandy feet, heavy beach bags and sea-soaked hair after a day of sipping Limonanas on the beach, we were thankful for an hour or two in our quiet flat \u2013 before heading out for a bit more Tel Aviv fun.\n\nWhere to stay:\n\nDeborah was a guest of Sea N\u2019 Rent, which has more than 60 luxury apartments in sought-after locations across Tel Aviv. She stayed at the Hilton Luxury Apartment \u2013 North, which costs between $200 to $550 per night.

Emergency crews are working hard to make sure that they can be there to rescue Hurricane Harvey victims, but lefist punks from the Black Lives Matter clique don\u2019t think people deserve to be saved.\n\nWhile blacks whined about having to spend a few minutes on rooftops as George W. Bush worked hard to keep people safe after Hurricane Katrina hit, they are now so \u201cwoke\u201d that their need to have people hear them scream that some thug who punched a cop got hurt (insert any one you can think of here) has dwarfed their desire to seed people safe from the Hurricane.\n\nPolice are currently engaged in a standoff with the \u201cprotesters,\u201d who decided to block traffic because Donald Trump is a \u201cracist\u201d according to chants from the unruly mob.\n\nAlready, fire trucks and ambulances are forced to turn around and find another route after the Black Lives Crew decided to flip one of them on its side. Two paramedics were injured in the attack.\n\nIf there is any problem with the response to this hurricane, the problem won\u2019t be with Trump who has made sure we are prepared in advance. It will be with these \u201ccivil rights activists\u201d who don\u2019t know when to leave well enough alone.", "source_url": "http://ourlandofthefree.com", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/120.jpg?resize=80%2C60", "https://i0.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/lolthisllmakethemmad.jpg?resize=678%2C381", "https://i0.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/lolthisllmakethemmad.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "https://i0.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/thesharpandthedead.jpg?resize=80%2C60", "http://ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cropped-lotf-site-header.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/youpeoplearegonnagoapeshitoverthis.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i1.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lolthesepeoplearemorons.jpg?resize=326%2C245", "https://i0.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rated-S.jpg?fit=146%2C212", "https://i1.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered.jpg?resize=326%2C245"], "fake or real": "f", "authors": ["David Tango", "David Is A God-fearing Patriot Who Wants To Put The Bible Back In Schools Make America Great Again Any Means Necessary He Is An Extremely Talented Journalist Who Has Won Eight Pulitzer Prizes The Sarah Palin Award For Excellence In Media", "Flagg Eagleton", "Tango Foxtrot", "About David"], "date": "2017-08-26"}]
